<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>The aim and scope of this book is sufficiently indicated
by its title. I have endeavoured throughout to restrict
my attention to questions connected with the origins
of art. Points of history and criticism have been
touched upon only in so far as they appeared to
contribute towards the elucidation of this purely
psychological and sociological problem. In order to
save space as well as to spare the reader’s attention, the
descriptive parts have been concentrated as much as
possible. As a rule, only one ethnological example,
which has been selected as typical, is described in the
text, while the corroborating examples are represented
by references in the footnotes. And even of these
references only such are adduced as have been considered
especially significant. Only in one matter
have I aimed at completeness, viz. that of reference to
authors from whom I have borrowed facts or observations.
And whenever in earlier literature I have found
theories which have appeared similar to the views
advanced in this book, these similarities have been
pointed out in the footnotes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span></p>

<p>There is one point, however, to which the reader’s
attention should be called in this Preface. When
treating of the art-impulse I have—especially in the
tenth chapter—mentioned in the footnotes some modern
writers on æsthetic, who, although starting from different
assumptions, have arrived at a conception of
art which in many points may be compared to the one
advanced in this book. This comparison, however, has
not been carried out in the text. Considerations of
space account for this omission; but it has a further
ground in the circumstances under which the present
work has originated. A part of it, containing the
examination of feeling and its expression, and the
chapter on “Animal Display,” was published in Swedish
as early as 1896<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>—that is, before the above-mentioned
authors had made their theories known. This is not
mentioned in order to raise any futile questions of
priority, but only as a justification of the way in which
my conclusions have been presented.</p>

<p>It has appeared to me that the continuity of the
argument could not but have been broken if, instead
of proceeding from my original starting-point, I had
based my conclusions upon a critical examination of
modern æsthetic doctrines. And I trust that the
differences between the thesis of this book and other
emotionalistic explanations will appear with sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
clearness to the attentive reader even if they have not
been expressly pointed out in the text.</p>

<p>There are, no doubt, many points, a fuller treatment
of which might have been to the advantage of the book.
The force of circumstances has compelled me to aim
at brevity before anything. But even if it had been
possible to give this study a far greater comprehensiveness,
the difficulties of expressing myself in a foreign
tongue would have withheld me from any avoidable
amplification. I have constantly been conscious of my
audacity in appearing before the English public without
sufficiently mastering the English language, and I have
been anxious not to make my offence greater by any
number of pages than it already is.</p>

<p>That it has been possible at all to publish this
research in English is only a result of the kind assistance
which I have received from my English friends. I
am indebted to Mr. G. G. Berry in Oxford, and Mr.
Leonard Pomeroy in London, who have revised parts of
the manuscript. And I am further indebted to my
publishers for procuring me the assistance of Mr. Stephen
Gwynn in preparing the book for the press. He has
helped me to avoid needlessly technical expressions,
and in other ways has given the work a more readable
style. But he has not restricted himself to these
emendations. He has assisted me with valuable suggestions
as well as with information. The improvement
which the work has derived from his collaboration
can be sufficiently appreciated only by its author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span></p>

<p>In purely scientific matters I have benefited much
from discussions with students of psychology and
sociology in my own country as well as in England.
My thanks are due to all of them, but especially to my
old friends, Dr. Edward Westermarck and Dr. Richard
Wallaschek.</p>

<p>The “List of Authorities quoted” and the Indexes
have been compiled by my wife. This is, however, only
the least important part of the assistance which throughout
the book has been rendered to me by the constant
collaborator in all my researches.</p>

<small>THE PROBLEM STATED</small></h2></div>


<p>When, one hundred and fifty years ago, Baumgarten
wrote the treatise to which he gave the name <cite>Aesthetica</cite>,
and which he described as a “theory of liberal arts and
beautiful thinking,” it seemed to him needful to apologise
for attracting attention to a field of inquiry so low and
sensuous as that province of philosophy to which he
then affixed a name. Many, he thought, might regard
art and beauty, which appeal primarily to the senses,
as subjects beneath the dignity of philosophers.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Yet
the theories and the ideas which were first brought
together as an organised body of thought in Baumgarten’s
short manual had so deeply influenced the
speculations of his age that, a generation later, the most
important questions of life came to be treated as
æsthetic problems. The philosophy of art, far from
needing to justify its existence, dominated all philosophy—ethics,
metaphysics, and even cosmogony. Imagination
was treated as the ruling faculty in all creation, and
beauty was referred to as the criterion, not only in art,
but in morality. Yet the importance thus given to
æsthetic speculation was transitory, and the period during
which philosophers were concerned, not only to find a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
general criterion of beauty for the arts, but also to apply
that criterion far beyond the sphere of art, has been
succeeded by an age which neglects speculation on art
and beauty for other tasks which are regarded as far
more important. Such rapid changes within a few
generations appear almost incomprehensible. But they
can easily be explained if we take into account the intimate
connection which always exists between æsthetic
speculation and prevailing currents of thought.</p>

<p>In Mr. Bosanquet’s <cite>History of Æsthetic</cite> it has been
pointed out with great clearness to what extent the
earlier prosperity of æsthetic studies was caused by the
general philosophical situation. The theory of æsthetic,
as set forth in Baumgarten’s chapter on <i>cognitio sensitiva</i>,
and further developed in Kant’s <i lang="de">Kritik der Urtheilskraft</i>,
dealt, as is well known, with a form of judgment which
is neither purely rational nor purely sensual.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In metaphysics,
for philosophers who had to struggle with what
seemed to them an irreconcilable opposition between
reason and the senses, this conception of a mediative
faculty must have satisfied a most urgent need.
Similarly we may suppose that the ethical observer
felt himself emancipated from the narrow antagonism
between body and spirit by looking at our actions in
the æsthetic way. In proportion, however, as general
science has been able to do away with the old dualism of
higher and lower faculties, the judgment of taste has
necessarily lost importance. In the development of
monistic philosophy and monistic morals we may thus
see one important factor, by the influence of which
æsthetic has been ousted from its central position.</p>

<p>The evolution of modern art has been still more
injurious to æsthetic speculation than the progress of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
science. In the palmy days of art-philosophy conditions
were eminently favourable to universal generalisations.
The great periods of art, classical antiquity and the
Renaissance, were so remote that only their simplest and
most salient features were discerned. Nor did the art
of the period exhibit the bewildering multiplicity of a
fertile age,—least of all in Germany, the home and centre
of æsthetic inquiry. The formative arts were less important
than ever before; music, which was so soon to
eclipse all other arts, had not yet awakened the interest
of philosophers. The crafts were at a low ebb; landscape-gardening
is indeed the only kind of applied art
that we hear about at this time. Beauty, art, the
ideal—these and all other general notions must have been
suggested with unsurpassable simplicity by this uniform
and monotonous artistic output. It is easy to understand
the eagerness and the delight with which the
earlier writers on æsthetic, once the impulse given, drew
conclusions, made comparisons, and laid down laws. But
it is equally evident that speculative zeal was bound to
fall off as soon as the province of art was enlarged and
its products differentiated.</p>

<p>Even the more intimate knowledge of classical
culture which was subsequently gained, necessitated
important corrections in æsthetic dogmas. The artistic
activities of savage tribes, which have been practically
unknown to æsthetic writers until recent years, display
many features that cannot be harmonised with the
general laws. And in a yet higher degree contemporary
art defies the generalisations of a uniform theory.
With greater mastery over materials and technique, the
different arts have been able to produce more and more
specialised forms of beauty. The painter’s ideal can no
longer be confused with that of the poet or the story-teller,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
nor the sculptor’s with that of the actor. Pure music,
pure poetry, pure painting, thus develop into isolated,
independent arts, of which each one establishes its own
laws and conditions for itself. The critic who, in spite of
this evolution, tries to apply a narrow æsthetic standard
of beauty to all the various arts may indeed—according
to his influence—delay the public appreciation of modern
works, and thus indirectly impede artistic development.
But no amount of theorising will enable him to arrest
the growth of artistic forms whose very existence contradicts
the generalisations of the old systems. And he
is equally powerless to stop such violations of the
supposed frontiers of the different arts as continually
occur, for instance, in descriptive music, or in poetry like
that of Gautier, which aims at producing a pictorial
impression by means of words.</p>

<p>It is only natural that, in times so inopportune,
general speculations on art and beauty have been more
and more abandoned in favour of detailed studies in the
technicalities of art, historical researches in which works
of art are considered chiefly as documents bearing on
culture, and experiments on the physiology and psychology
of æsthetic perception. For art itself and its
development it would perhaps be unimportant if a
science which has never exercised any great positive and
direct influence on artistic production should completely
disappear. But from the theoretical point of view it
would be matter for regret if artistic activities ceased
to be considered as a whole. And so also would it be if
æsthetic feelings, judgments of taste, and ideals of
beauty came to be treated only in appendices to works
on psychology. It is true that all these notions have
irremediably lost their former metaphysical and philosophical
importance. But in compensation, art and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
beauty have for modern thinking acquired a social and
psychological significance. To determine the part which
the production and the enjoyment of works of art play
in their relation to the other factors of individual and
social life—that is indeed a task which is momentous
enough to be treated in a science of its own. Modern
æsthetic, therefore, has still its own ends, which, if not
so ambitious as those of the former speculative science
of beauty, are nevertheless of no small importance.
These ends, however, can no longer be attained by the
procedure of the old æsthetic systems. As the problems
have changed with changing conditions, so too the
methods must be brought into line with the general
scientific development. Historical and psychological
investigation must replace the dialectic treatment of the
subject. Art can no longer be deduced from general,
philosophical, and metaphysical principles; it must be
studied—by the methods of inductive psychology—as a
human activity. Beauty cannot be considered as a
semi-transcendental reality; it must be interpreted as
an object of human longing and a source of human
enjoyment. In æsthetic proper, as well as in the
philosophy of art, every research must start, not from
theoretical assumptions, but from the psychological and
sociological data of the æsthetic life.</p>

<p>Such a procedure, however, is encumbered with
difficulties, of which the writers on speculative æsthetic
were scarcely aware. When theories of art and beauty
were based on general <i>a priori</i> principles, there could
not possibly be any doubt as to the point of departure
in the several researches. But when we have no
assumptions to start from, the very demarcation of the
subject may become a matter of uncertainty. In the
philosophy of art, to which department of æsthetic I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
wish to restrict my researches in the present work, this
difficulty of formulating the data and <i lang="la">quæsita</i>—the facts
which we have to go upon, and the facts which we wish
to find out—constitutes the first, and by no means the
least important, problem.</p>

<p>If we are to embark upon a scientific treatment of art
without any preconceived definitions, the aim and conditions
of such treatment can only be determined by
examining the prevailing notions on the subject, as they
are expressed in language and in literature. As an
interpretation for general use and of general applicability,
a theory of art can claim attention only if it conforms
to the recognised usage of the principal æsthetic terms.
In the various definitions of art which are contained in
the different æsthetic systems, we must therefore try to
find some point of unity from which to approach our
subject. The difficulties of such a task are evident to
any one who has gone through the discouraging experience
of reading a history of æsthetic. The investigator
who seeks an accurate demarcation of the whole
area of art, as distinguished from other departments of
life, meets with partial definitions which can be applied
only to certain fixed forms of art. We need mention
but a few of the most typical instances. Even an
ardent admirer of Taine is compelled to admit that his
generalisations are too exclusively derived from the
study of poetry and the formative arts. In the same
way it is only by laborious adjustments that the theory
of Vischer can be applied to music and lyric poetry;
the aphorisms of Ruskin do not even pretend to apply
to any but the formative arts; and Mr. Marshall’s
<cite>Æsthetic Principles</cite>—to adduce one of the most recent
attempts in general art-theory—are too obviously those
of an expert in architecture. In none of the modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
systems has sufficient room been made for certain forms
of art which, from the evolutionist’s standpoint, are of
the highest importance: such as acting, dancing, and
decoration. All the one-sided definitions are, moreover,
so inconsistent with each other that it seems impossible
to make up for their individual deficiencies by
an eclectic combination. It is not to be wondered at,
therefore, if some writers on art, confused by the
bewildering contradictions of æsthetic theories, have
called in question the very existence of any universal
art-criterion.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Those who adopt this attitude—which seems the
more justified now that the arts have become widely
differentiated—deny the possibility, not only of all
general art-philosophy, but also of any sociological and
psychological treatment of artistic activities as a whole.
But even if all other hypotheses are banished, æsthetic
research cannot possibly dispense with the fundamental
assumption of the unity of art. And in point of fact
there can be found in most systems, if we do not insist
on too minute and positive demarcations, at least one
common quality which is ascribed to all its different
forms. Notwithstanding the mutual contradictions
of art-theories, the believers in a general æsthetic
can always appeal to the consent with which the
majority of authors have upheld the negative criterion
of art. Metaphysicians as well as psychologists,
Hegelians as well as Darwinians, all agree in declaring
that a work, or performance, which can be proved to
serve any utilitarian, non-æsthetic object must not be
considered as a genuine work of art. True art has its
one end in itself, and rejects every extraneous purpose:
that is the doctrine which, with more or less explicitness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
has been stated by Kant,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Schiller,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Spencer,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Hennequin,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Grosse,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Grant Allen,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and others. And popular opinion
agrees in this respect with the conclusions of science.
This distinctive quality of independence seems therefore
to afford us a convenient starting-point for the treatment
of art in general.</p>

<p>Owing to its negative character, this criterion does
not give us much information as to the real qualities of
art. But even the poorest definition is enough to begin
with, if it only holds good with regard to all particular
cases. Unfortunately, however, we need only apply
the test of independence in the concrete instance to
find that even the applicability of this single accepted
criterion may be seriously disputed. There is scarcely
any author, however he may formulate his general
definitions of art, who would assess the relative value
of art-works according to their degrees of disinterestedness.
No candid man would, for instance, nowadays
contend that an arabesque composition is <i>per se</i> more
æsthetically pure than a statue or a poem.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But we
may even go farther. We must question whether every
work of art ought to be degraded from its æsthetic rank,
if it can be convicted of having served any external
utilitarian purpose. This strict conception of the
æsthetic boundaries has been eloquently attacked by
Guyau in his celebrated treatise, <cite>Le principe de l’art et
de la poésie</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Though the ultimate conclusions of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
work are perhaps not so clear as might be desired, yet
we do not see how his attitude in estimating concrete
manifestations of art can be assailed. It would, to take
an example, be absurd to contend that the singing of
Taillefer lost in æsthetic value by contributing to the
victory of Hastings. And however strictly we may insist
upon the requirement that every genuine work of
art should have been created purely for its own sake,
we cannot possibly conceal the fact that some of the
world’s finest love lyrics were originally composed, not in
æsthetic freedom, which is independent of all by-purposes,
but with the express end of gaining the ear and the favour
of a beloved woman. The influence which such foreign,
non-æsthetic motives have exercised on art will also
become more and more apparent with increased knowledge
of the conditions of æsthetic production. The
further the psychological biographer pushes his indiscreet
researches into the private life of individual artists, the
more often will he find that some form of interest—personal,
political, ethical, religious—enters into the so-called
disinterested æsthetic activity. Such instances
must induce undogmatic authors to relax to some extent
the strict application of this criterion. And even those
philosophers who, in spite of the historical evidence, insist
upon applying it will be compelled to admit that
they have taken for works of genuine art productions
which, from their philosophic standpoint, have no claim
to the title.</p>

<p>The danger of such mistakes is all the greater when
one has to deal with the lower stages of artistic development.
In point of fact recent ethnological researches
have conclusively proved that it is not only difficult, but
quite impossible, to apply the criterion of æsthetic independence
to the productions of savage and barbarous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
tribes. It is true that the large province of primitive
art has not as yet in its entirety been made the subject
of systematic study. But, on the other hand, the results
which have been arrived at with regard to decoration,
its most typical form, amply bear out our view.
In almost every case where the ornaments of a tribe
have been closely examined, it has appeared that what
to us seems a mere embellishment is for the natives
in question full of practical, non-æsthetic significance.
Carvings on weapons and implements, tattooings, woven
and plaited patterns, all of which the uncritical observer
is apt to take for purely artistic compositions, are now
explained as religious symbols, owners’ marks, or ideograms.
There is still room for discussion as to whether
in certain individual interpretations the tendency to
look for concealed meanings has not been carried too
far. But there can be no doubt that the general
principles which to many students seemed so fantastic
when first formulated by Stolpe, Read,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and others, have
derived additional support from every fresh inquiry into
primitive systems of decoration.</p>

<p>The isolated researches which have been carried on
within the department of primitive literature and drama
all point in the same direction. Wherever ethnologists
have the opportunity of gaining some insight into the
inner life of a savage tribe, they are surprised at the
religious or magical significance which lies concealed behind
the most apparently trivial of amusements. And
it is to be remarked that they have learned to appreciate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
this esoteric meaning, not by a closer study of the
manifestations themselves, but through information
acquired by intercourse with the natives. There is
often not a single feature in a savage dance which would
give the uninitiated any reason to suspect the non-æsthetic
purpose. When North American Indians,
Kaffirs, or Negroes perform a dance in which all the
movements of the animals they hunt are imitated, we
unavoidably see in their antics an instance of primitive
but still purely artistic drama. It is only from the
descriptions of Catlin, Lichtenstein, and Reade<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that we
learn that these pantomimes have in reality quite as
practical a purpose as those imitations and representations
of animals by which hunters all over the world try
to entice their game within shooting distance. According
to the doctrine of sympathetic magic, it is simply an
axiomatic truth that the copy of a thing may at any
distance influence the thing itself, and that thus a
buffalo dance, even when it is performed in the camp,
may compel the buffaloes to come within range of the
hunters. But the deceptive appearance of disinterestedness,
which in these cases might have led one to mistake
a mere piece of hunting magic for a specimen of pure
dramatic art, is apt to make us cautious about accepting
as independently æsthetic any performance of primitive
man.</p>

<p>In the songs and dances by which savages exhort
themselves to work and regulate their exertions we find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
an aspect of utilitarian advantage which is real and not
imaginary. Evidently also this advantage, and not any
independent æsthetic pleasure, is—intentionally or unintentionally—aimed
at in the war-pantomimes, the boating
songs, dances, etc. And it is no doubt for this
reason that music and dance have attained so surprising
a development in the lower stages of culture. In
trying, therefore, to explain the historical development
of art, we are compelled to take into account
that foreign purpose which is repudiated in art-theory.</p>

<p>If every work of art were really an end in itself—a
<i lang="de">Selbstzweck</i>—standing quite isolated from all the
practical utilities of life, it would be nothing less than
a miracle that art should be met with in tribes which have
not yet learnt to satisfy, nor even to feel, the most
elementary necessities of life. In such a case it is not
music only which would, as Wallace thinks, have to be
explained by supernatural causes:<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> primitive art in all
its departments would baffle our attempts at rational
interpretation. By studying, however, the artistic
activities of savage and barbarous man in their connection
with his non-æsthetic life, writers on evolutionary
æsthetic have succeeded in solving this great crux
of art-history. The dances, poems, and even the
formative arts of the lower tribes possess indeed, as
every ethnologist will admit, unquestionable æsthetic
value. But this art is seldom free and disinterested; it
has generally a usefulness—real or supposed—and is
often even a necessity of life.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>A historical conception of art is thus, it appears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
incompatible with a strict maintenance of the æsthetic
criterion. But it may still be asked whether we are
therefore compelled to join Guyau in abolishing all distinctions
between art and other manifestations of human
energy.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> By doing away with the only definition
which is common to the majority of æsthetic systems,
we should dissociate ourselves from all previous views
on art. And it seems hard to believe that all dogmatic
writers on æsthetic, one-sided as they may often seem,
have founded their theories on a pure fiction. The
independent æsthetic activity, which simply aims at
its own satisfaction, cannot have been invented for
the sake of the systems. The mere fact that so
many theories have been proposed for its explanation
furnishes, it seems to us, a sufficient proof that the
conception of this activity corresponds to some psychological
reality. Certainly the “end in itself” has not
played so important a part in the practice of artists as
writers on æsthetic would have us believe; and it
is impossible to distinguish its effects in concrete
individual instances. But from all we know of the
life and work of artists, there appears to be a tendency—more
or less consciously followed, it is true, in
different cases—to make the work its own end. And
in the public we can in the same way notice an inclination—which
grows with increasing culture—to regard
art as something which exists for its own sake, and
to contemplate its manifestations with independent
æsthetic attention. Whatever we may think about
the genesis of particular pictures and poems, we know
that at least they need no utilitarian, non-æsthetic
justification in order to be appreciated by us. And
with as much assurance as we can ever feel in com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>parative
psychology we may take it for granted that
the same way of looking at art has prevailed in other
stages of culture as well. However cautious one may
be in drawing conclusions from analogies between
higher and lower forms, a closer study of primitive art
must needs compel every one to admit that these
dances, poems, and ornaments, even if they originally
served practical, religious, or political aims, may at least
have come by degrees to be enjoyed in the same way
as we enjoy our art. By denying such subjective
independence in the creation and enjoyment of art, we
should be no less guilty of one-sidedness than those
authors who deny that genuine art has ever been
influenced by “foreign purposes.” If it is presumptuous
to adduce any particular works or manifestations
in proof of free and independent production, it
may be no less audacious to contend that even the
most primitive form of art has flourished in tribes
destitute of all æsthetic cravings. There is room for
discussion on the degree of influence which “autotelic”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
artistic activity has exercised in particular works and
manifestations. It may also be made an object of
research to determine at which precise stage of development
æsthetic attention becomes so emancipated
as to entitle us to speak of a pure and free art-life.
But it does not seem that such inquiries can ever lead
to any positive result. The more one studies art,
especially primitive art, from a comparative and
historical point of view, the more one is compelled to
admit the impossibility of deciding where the non-æsthetic
motives end and the æsthetic motives begin.
The only result we can reach is the somewhat indefinite
one that it is as impossible to explain away the artistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
purpose as it is to detect its presence in a pure state in
any concrete work of art.</p>

<p>For art-philosophy as a distinct science even this
non-committal conclusion is of vital importance. It
gives us a right to regard all the forms and developments
of art as witnesses to an activity which tends to
become more and more independent of the immediate
utilities of life. This tendency, on the other hand,
not only affords us a point of unity from which to
start upon a research into the general philosophy of
art; it also presents to us one of the greatest problems
of the same science. How it is that mankind has come
to devote energy and zeal to an activity which may be
almost entirely devoid of a utilitarian purpose is indeed
the riddle, sociological as well as psychological, which
would seem in the first place to claim the attention of
the philosopher. To the writer of this book, at any
rate, it appeared that a discussion, and an attempt at
solution, of this seeming paradox was a task sufficiently
important and interesting to form of itself the subject
of a special investigation.</p>

<p>But although the aspects of autotelic artistic activity
give us at once a datum and a problem on which we
may confidently base our research, we must not overlook
the peculiar difficulties that will necessarily arise
from the exclusively psychological, non-historical
character of this basis. A historic study of art shows
us that the artistic activity proper can never be
explained by examining concrete works as we meet
them in reality. Whenever we have to deal with art as
autotelic, the need of theoretical abstraction forces itself
upon us with irresistible cogency. It is of no avail to
argue from the data of art-history, because we can never
fully know the mental origin of the works. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
problem presented to us by the tendency to engage in
artistic production and artistic enjoyment for their own
sake can only be solved by studying the psychology
both of artists and of their public. The “art-impulse”
and the “art-sense,” as referring to subjective tendencies
in creators and spectators, are the chief notions with
which we have to operate in such an investigation. And
when we are obliged to introduce the notion of the
“work of art” we have to remember that this term,
strictly speaking, refers to an abstract and ideal datum.
Only by thus restricting our attention to the psychical
facts can we attain any clear conception of that autotelic
aspect of art on which so much stress has been laid in
all æsthetic philosophy.</p>

<p>It is needless to say, however, that even a purely
philosophic interpretation of art would be impossible
without a knowledge of its works and manifestations as
they appear in real life, with all their extraneous, non-æsthetic
elements. The psychological examination must
therefore necessarily be supplemented by an historical
one. The methods of the latter research cannot be the
same as those used in a strictly æsthetic inquiry. And
the words will naturally be employed in a different sense.
We do not at that stage demand of a poem, a painting,
or a drama, that it should fulfil more than the technical
requirements of the several arts. The ornamentation of
a vase, <i>e.g.</i> is in this sense a work of art even if it serves
a magical, <i>i.e.</i> a supposed practical purpose. Indeed it
is most advantageous, if we wish to bring out the
influence of sociological factors with the greatest possible
clearness, to concentrate our attention upon the very
qualities which we have to disregard in the treatment of
purely artistic activity. The productions of primitive
tribes, in which art is so closely connected with life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
supply the most profitable material for such a study.
After having examined, in these simple forms, all the
sociological aspects of art, it will be possible to place the
two art-factors in the most illustrative antithesis and to
study their mutual influence. From this it should be
possible to suggest—although in this work no detailed
attempt will be made to follow out the reasoning—why
it is that the concrete work of art, although its historical
origin may be entirely non-æsthetic, has always proved
so eminently adapted to serve the needs of the purely
aesthetic craving. And by starting from the conception
of æsthetic activities which has been arrived at on psychological
grounds, it should also be possible to determine
the particular qualities in individual works of art which
make them more or less able to satisfy this craving.
Thus a theory of the psychological and sociological
origins of art may furnish suggestions for those which
have been considered as distinctive of æsthetic proper,
such as the critical estimation of works of art, or the
derivation of laws which govern artistic production.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE ART-IMPULSE</small></h2></div>


<p>There are two things which have to be investigated—the
reason why works of art are created, and the reason
why works of art are enjoyed. By choosing at the outset
to approach art in its active aspect—to examine into
the impulse of the artist—we do not desert the central
field of æsthetic inquiry. On the contrary, it seems that
a study of art-production affords the most convenient
starting-point for any comprehensive treatment of art;
all the more because every æsthetic pleasure, even when
apparently most passive, always involves an element of
unconscious artistic creation.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> When absorbed in the
beauty of nature we do in fact appear to ourselves to be
entirely receptive; but in truth our enjoyment, if the
enjoyment has any æsthetic value at all, is always more
or less derived from the activity of our own mind. It
does not matter much, from the psychological point of
view, whether we make an abortive but original
effort to select and arrange the impressions which we
receive, as is the case when a new aspect of nature
delights us, or whether we merely reproduce at second
hand the impression originally arranged by an artist, as
happens when we admire a statue, or recognise in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
landscape some effect that Turner has recorded.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In
either case the passive attitude can never be explained
without reference to the active one.</p>

<p>In the historic interpretation of art it is of no less
importance to study its productive side. It is only by
considering art as an activity that we can explain the
great influence which it has exercised on social as
well as on individual life. These are, however, views
which can only be properly established in the later
chapters. Here we have merely to dwell on the aspects
which present themselves to the psychological observer;
and there is no doubt that from his point of view the
impulse to produce works of pure art constitutes the chief
æsthetic problem. If once the creation has been satisfactorily
accounted for, it is relatively easy to explain
the subsequent enjoyment of art. Accordingly, by
concentrating our attention on the art-impulse we
approach the art-problem at its very core.</p>

<p>It has, however, been contended by some authors
that the independence of external motives is nothing
peculiar to art-production. There is, undoubtedly, a
certain kind of scientific study—for instance, some
departments of higher mathematics—which may be
carried on entirely for its own sake without any regard
to practical application, or even to increased knowledge
of nature. And it is even more impossible to find any
immediate utilitarian purpose for all the intense activity,
mental and physical, which is devoted to sports and
games. Every one knows that the “end in itself” which
any of these affords may in many cases exercise as great
an attraction as any of the utilitarian aims in life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Chess is said to have a demoniac power over its devotees,
and the attachment of a golfer to his game can only be
described in the language of the most intense passion.
The same sacrifice of energy and interests to a one-sided
and apparently useless purpose, which in art seems so
mysterious, may thus, as Professor Groos remarks, be
found in activities of far less repute.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It is evident that
if artistic creation were in no wise different from
these other examples of autotelic manifestations, there
would be no ground for considering the art-impulse as a
separate or distinctive problem.</p>

<p>We can scarcely believe, however, that even Professor
Groos himself would seriously maintain the parallel
between art-production and the last-mentioned activities.
There are indeed cases in which a man of science
devotes his whole energy to a task which is so abstract
that it seems to give no satisfaction to the craving for
positive truth. But it is always an open question
whether the attractiveness of such researches is not,
strictly speaking, more æsthetic than scientific. Higher
mathematics is perhaps, for those that live in the world
of abstract quantities, only an abstract form of art, a
soundless music or a wordless poetry. In other cases
the eagerness with which pure science is pursued as an
autotelic end may be explained as a result of acquired
habits. Like the miser, the passionate researcher may
often gradually lose sight of the ultimate aim of his
activity and concentrate all his attention on the means.
There can be no question of denying the emotional
value and the great attractive force which thus comes
to be attached to these secondary purposes. But in
comparing such autotelic activities to those of art we
have to remember that the passion, however intense it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
may be, is probably not primary but derived; and it is
in any case self-evident that it can be developed only
in exceptional cases and in peculiarly predisposed
individuals.</p>

<p>By the same criterion we can also separate the art-desire
from the love of games and sports. However
passionate the sporting mania may be in individuals or
nations, it can never be compared as a universal and
primary impulse with the craving for æsthetic creation.
Philosophers who bestow their whole attention only on
the mature works which can be studied in the history
of art, may indeed contend that even the art-impulse is
given to some favoured few. But this view, which
would reduce all art-life to the status of a great and
marvellous exception, cannot possibly be upheld in a
psychological æsthetic.</p>

<p>It is, no doubt, the fact that the percentage of
executive artists in modern nations is an almost
negligible quantity. It is also probable that—contrary
to a common notion—the poets, the painters, and
the dramatists form a distinct class even among the
lower tribes.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But in treating the art-impulse as a
psychological phenomenon the inquiry cannot be restricted
to the few individuals who publicly practise a
certain art. As far as the artistic <i>powers</i> are concerned,
these undoubtedly stand apart from the rest of mankind.
But we are not entitled to maintain that they are also
distinguished by some peculiar psychical <i>impulse</i>. From
the point of view of artistic perfection, there is all the
world between the youthful verses of Goethe and the
doggerel of a common schoolboy. But, psychologically,
the schoolboy’s doggerel may be the result of as
strong a craving for poetic expression as any of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
world’s greatest poems.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Bad or good, known or
unknown, every manifestation of artistic activity is
equally illustrative for our purpose. We have to count
with the immense number of dilettanti who produce in
privacy and in secret, as well as with recognised artists.
And even those unfortunate persons who have never
been able to find for themselves any satisfactory mode
of æsthetic expression may still be adduced in proof of
the universality of the artistic desire. If the notion of
art is conceived in its most general sense, every normal
man, at some time of his life at least, is an artist—in
aspiration, if not in capacity.</p>

<p>If, moreover, we take into consideration the eagerness
and devotion which is lavished upon artistic
activity—not least, perhaps, by those who have never
appeared as artists—we shall be compelled to admit
that the art-impulse is not only commoner, but also
stronger and deeper, than any of the above-mentioned
non-utilitarian impulses. If it can be explained at all,
it is only by deriving it from some great and fundamental
tendency of the human mind. This fact has,
naturally enough, not been realised by those writers on
æsthetic who only study the ideal work of art as it
appears among civilised nations. In short, the great
systems of æsthetic philosophy have never expressly
stated the problem of finding an origin for the art-impulse;
and any interpretation of that impulse which
may be derived constructively from their speculations
upon the work of acknowledged artists is irreconcilable
with the wider notion of art as a universal human
activity. If the aim of every artist really were, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Vischer must have thought, to reinstate by the creation
of a semblance the Idea in the position from which it is
in Reality always thrust by material accidents; if he
desired, for instance, to show a human character as it
would be but for the accidents of life;<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> or if, to use the
language of Taine, the artist’s main object were to
produce a representation of nature in which the essential
characters enjoy an absolute sovereignty; if he strove
to depict a lion in such a way to emphasise specially
these leonine traits which distinguish the lion from any
other great cat,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>—then it would be hard to understand
the attraction which art has exercised on people who
are almost devoid of intellectual cravings. We could
not possibly find any connection between modern and
primitive art. Nor could we explain why, for instance,
poetry and music are so often cultivated by persons who
do not otherwise show the slightest eagerness to understand
the hidden nature of things, who do not meddle
with ideas or “dominating faculties.” Even in the case of
philosophically-minded artists such motives are probably
somewhat feeble. The intellectualistic definitions may
perhaps explain the æsthetic qualities of the work of
art itself. But they can never account for the constraining
force by which every genuine work of art is
called into existence.</p>

<p>There are some authors, however, who have felt the
need of a dynamic explanation of the art-impulse,
which should trace the motive force to its origin. It
was so with Aristotle when he interpreted artistic production
as a manifestation of the desire to imitate. By
this theory art is indeed brought into connection with
a general animal impulse, the æsthetic importance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
which can scarcely be overestimated. It is only by
reference to the psychology of imitative movements
that we shall be able to explain the enjoyment of art.
But it seems, nevertheless, somewhat strained to make
imitation the basis and purpose of artistic activity, seeing
that there are various forms of art, as, for instance, architecture
and purely lyrical music or poetry, in which we
can scarcely detect any imitative element at all. The
theories of Aristotle, of Seneca, and all their modern
followers, can only be upheld if the word “imitation” is
used in a much wider sense than that which it generally
bears. But even those who, with Engel, would consider
the bodily movements as “imitating the thoughts,”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> or
those who in æsthetic would speak of “circulary reaction”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
as a phenomenon of imitation, would find it
hard to discover in any of these relatively automatic
manifestations such a mental compulsion as that which
impels to artistic activity. Moreover, as we need scarcely
point out, art in all its forms always strives after something
more than a mere likeness.</p>

<p>It seems equally superfluous to emphasise the fact
that no genuine artist has made it his sole object to
please. The fatal confusion between art-theory and
the science of beauty has indeed led some writers on
æsthetic to derive artistic activities from an impulse to
“produce objects or objective conditions which should
attract by pleasing.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Such views will especially
recommend themselves to those who believe in an
animal art called forth by sexual selection. Nor can it
be denied that the means of attraction employed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
competition for the favour of the opposite sex supply a
part of the material which is used in the various arts.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
With the artistic impulse itself, which, according to its
very definition, is independent of external motives, the
various means of attraction have no connection whatever.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>From the theoretical point of view it is undoubtedly
easier to defend Professor Baldwin’s way of stating the
case, in which the “self-exhibiting impulse” takes the
place of the “instinct to attract by pleasing.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Figuratively
speaking, an element of self-exhibition is involved
in every artistic creation which addresses itself to a
public. And without a public—in the largest sense of
the word—no art would ever have appeared. But it seems
somewhat difficult to make this self-exhibiting—in a
sense which implies an actual audience—the aim and
purpose of, for instance, the most intimate and personal
examples of lyrical poetry.</p>

<p>It may of course be contended, by those who advocate
the importance of the last-mentioned interpretations,
that the variety of art-forms compels us to assume, not
one, but several art-impulses. At this stage of our
research we cannot enter upon a discussion of such
views; but it will at least be admitted that explanations
which can be applied in the whole field of art
must be preferable to partial definitions.</p>

<p>This merit of universality, at least, cannot be
denied to the theories which derive art from the playing
impulse. The notion of a sportive activity involves
precisely that freedom from external, consciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
utilitarian motives which, according to the consensus of
almost all writers on æsthetic, is required in every
genuine manifestation of art. It is not surprising, therefore,
that it was by reference to the play-impulse that
Schiller tried to distinguish artistic production from all
“unfree” forms of activity.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It is true that the notion
of “play” as used by Schiller and Spencer—who has
given the theory a physiological foundation—is chiefly
important as a negative demarcation. But even Schiller
brings in a positive factor when he speaks of the force
by which “overflowing life itself urges the animal to
action” (“wenn das überflüssige Leben sich selbst zur
Thätigkeit stachelt”).<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In Spencer’s theory, on the other
hand, the “excessive readiness” to nervous discharge
which accompanies every surplus of vigour, and which,
in his view, accounts for play, represents a motor
element, the impelling force of which must be considered
as very strong.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> As is well known, Spencer, Wallace,
and Hudson have applied this principle of surplus
energy to explain so-called animal art, rejecting the
theory which ascribes æsthetic judgment to the female.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>As formulated by the last-mentioned authors, the
play-theory is, however, open to objection from a
physiological point of view. It has been remarked
by Dr. Wallaschek that, in speaking of animals, the
phrase “surplus of vigour” ought to be superseded by
“inapplicability of energy” or “unemployed energy.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
And still more explicitly Professor Groos has shown that
a stored-up supply of energy is by no means a necessary
condition for play.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But these criticisms have by no
means deprived the play-instinct of its importance as
a dynamic factor. Since Groos by his epoch-making
researches has been able to prove that the majority of
games—especially the games of youth—are based upon
instincts, we can adduce as an impelling force “the
demon instinct that urges and even compels to activity
not only if and so long as the vessel overflows (to use a
figure of speech), but even when there is but a last
drop left in it.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> By considering artistic activity as a
kind of play, one is therefore able to account for its
great attractiveness, even when no “surplus of vigour”
can be shown to exist.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this chapter we did indeed
contend that the “compulsion” which prompts to
artistic activity is too strong to be even compared with
the passion for sports and games. But this superiority
may of course be explained as a result of some
peculiarity of this special kind of play. As a matter of
fact art is, in a far higher degree than any of the sports
and games, able to satisfy the <i>greatest</i> and most <i>fundamental</i>
instincts of man. Groos has tried to prove
that the artistic motives which in all times have been
most popular, offer to the spectator as well as to the
producer an opportunity for warlike and erotic stimulation;<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and Guyau had already remarked how im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>portant
a part the moods of war, or rather of struggle,
play in all enjoyment of art.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It is easy to understand
the eager prosecution of an activity which thus affords
free, if imaginary, exercise for instincts and tendencies
which would otherwise be thwarted by the narrow
restrictions of social life. We are all animals in
captivity, and we eagerly seize every kind of vicarious
function which can give at least a memory of the life
from which we are excluded.</p>

<p>At lower stages of social evolution, where instincts
are more in harmony with life, the play-element in art
must evidently be of still greater importance. Artistic
production and artistic enjoyment provide exercise for
those very functions which are most important in real
life. Art fulfils a great social mission, and is developed
in subservience to the struggle for life. The play-theory,
as formulated by Professor Groos, affords, therefore, in
many cases an explanation of the high artistic level
reached by the lower tribes. In our historical treatment
of primitive dances and dramas we shall be continually
obliged to have recourse to this theory. And it will
thus appear that it is no deficient appreciation of its
importance which compels us to look elsewhere for an
explanation for the artistic impulse.</p>

<p>Play and art have indeed many important characteristics
in common. Neither of them has any immediate
practical utility, and both of them do nevertheless
serve some of the fundamental needs of life. All art,
therefore, can in a certain sense be called play. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
art is something more than this. The aim of play is
attained when the surplus of vigour is discharged or
the instinct has had its momentary exercise. But the
function of art is not confined to the act of production;
in every manifestation of art, properly so called, something
is made and something survives. It is true that
in certain manifestations—for instance in the dance or
in acting—the effect is destroyed as soon as created; it
survives only in the rhythm devised by the dancer, or
in the spectator’s memory of the part played. But this
is accidental, not essential to the nature of the arts as
arts. On the other hand, there is nothing in the nature
of the play-impulse to call for a stereotyping of the
state of mind and feelings to which it gives rise. Still
less can the artistic qualities, such as beauty and rhythm,
which, however difficult to define scientifically, always
characterise works of art, be interpreted as a result of
the play-impulse. The theories of Schiller, Spencer,
and Groos may indeed explain the negative criterion of
art, but they cannot, any more than the imitation
theories or the Darwinian interpretation, give us any
positive information as to the nature of art.</p>

<p>In order to understand the art-impulse as a tendency
to æsthetic production, we must bring it into connection
with some function, from the nature of which the
specifically artistic qualities may be derived. Such a
function is to be found, we believe, in the activities of
emotional expression.</p>

<p>It is therefore to the psychology of feeling and
expression that we shall turn for the solution of the
problem of the art-impulse.</p>

<small>THE FEELING-TONE OF SENSATION</small></h2></div>


<p>Before attempting to prove that the impelling force in
art-creation is to be explained by the psychology of
feeling, we must first pay some attention to the general
theory of emotional states. It would be impossible to
assert anything about the æsthetic importance of such
activities as have their origin in emotional conditions
without first having made out the relation between
feeling and movement.</p>

<p>In this purely psychological investigation it is advantageous
to postpone all æsthetic considerations. The
important thing is to get hold of the mental factors in
their simplest possible form. Even the lowest feelings,
therefore, the feeling-tones of mere physical sensation
or the vaguest emotional states, such as comfort or
discomfort, which are overlooked in all works on æsthetic
proper, may be of great value in this preliminary discussion.</p>

<p>It is preferable to begin with the feeling-tones of
definitely physical origin, because these hedonic elements
have been subjected to an experimental investigation
which could never be undertaken with regard to the
complex emotions and sentiments. As early as 1887
Féré published some important researches on the re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>lation
between sensation and movement. By submitting
persons to various external stimuli, he showed
that every such stimulus calls forth a modification of
the activities of the body, which modification, according
to the intensity and the duration of the stimulus, takes
the character either of enhancement or of arrest. In
all cases when the apparatus used in the experiments
indicated a shortened reaction-time and an increased
development of energy, the subject of the experiment
had experienced a feeling of pleasure. Every painful
stimulus, on the other hand, was connected with a
diminution of energy.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>These results have been corroborated in the main
by the later researches of Lehmann. He has not, however,
restricted his attention to the development of
energy, but has also measured the changes in pulsation
and respiration which occur under the influence of
various stimuli. His conclusions are these:—</p>

<p>“Simple pleasurable sensations are accompanied by
dilatation of the blood-vessels, and perhaps also by an
increase in the amplitude of heart-contraction, together
with an increase in the innervation of the voluntary
muscles, at least of those connected with respiration.
In sensations of pain one has to distinguish the first
shock of irritation from the subsequent state. At the
moment of irritation there ensues a deeper inhalation,
and, if the irritation is strong, also an increase in the
innervation of voluntary muscles. Then there generally
follows a relaxation.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The physiological theory of pleasure and pain which
can be deduced from these experiments is, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
neither new nor original. Féré has himself pointed out
that his researches only serve to prove the views which
have been advanced with more or less explicitness by
Kant, Bain, Darwin, and Dumont.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> All authors who
have closely studied the movements of expression have
also remarked that pleasurable feelings are accompanied
by a tendency towards increased activity (Gratiolet,
Darwin, Bain, Bouillier, Mantegazza).<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> And the popular
views on pleasure and pain, as we find them expressed
in literature, all agree on this point: “La joie est l’air
vital de notre âme. La tristesse est un asthme compliqué
d’atonie.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Every one knows that movement and
unchecked increased activity generally create pleasure.
And, on the other hand, functional inhibition is in our
experience closely connected with feelings of pain.</p>

<p>Although these broad facts are universally recognised,
there is nevertheless no unanimity with regard
to their interpretation. It may be held, on the one
hand, that the perception of those objective conditions
which call forth pleasure is accompanied by a tendency
to movement. That, conversely, movement creates
pleasure would thus be the result of an association. But
it may also be contended that the functional enhancement,
the stimulation itself, when present to consciousness,
is perceived as pleasure, and that the feeling-tone
created by movement is thus not indirect and secondary,
but, on the contrary, is a typical pleasure.</p>

<p>We do not by any means deny the influence which
associative processes exercise on all our feelings and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the activities connected with them. As has been shown
by Darwin, animals as well as primitive man have
earned their chief enjoyment, outside their delight of
warmth and repose, by violent actions, such as hunting,
war, and pairing fights.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> And if it be objected that
memories from those distant times cannot now influence
our feelings, it must at least be admitted that within
the life of the individual a firm foundation is laid
for association between pleasure and activity.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Independently
of all general theories, we must therefore
reckon with association as a factor by which the motor
element of pleasure is greatly increased. But it seems
to us impossible to make the remembrance—conscious
or unconscious—of earlier similar states the only ground
of the activity which is connected with pleasurable
feelings.</p>

<p>It is at least far more simple and consistent to
explain, with Hamilton and Bain, the activity itself as
the physiological condition of pleasure. If any increase
of function—whether brought about by chemical,
mechanical, or psychical (that is, indirectly mechanical)
influences—be considered as a physiological condition of
pleasure, and any arrest of function in the same way
be considered as a counterpart of pain, then all states of
pleasure or pain may be included in one common
interpretation. Only it must be remembered that
the increase of function can never be measured by any
absolute standard. The same stimulus which in one
individual calls forth pleasure may in another individual
cause pain, and the same bodily activity which we
enjoy when in a vigorous state of health may occasion
suffering when we are weak or ill. Such variations are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
evidently conditioned by the varying functional powers
of the organs involved. When these powers are
reduced, a stimulus, or a movement which usually produces
a stimulating effect, may instead call forth
depression and pain.</p>

<p>In every explanation of pleasure-pain, attention
must therefore be paid not only to the claims which
are made on the several organs by the objective causes
(stimuli or movements), but also to the capacity of the
organs to meet these claims. This capacity, on the
other hand, is evidently dependent upon the supply of
energy afforded by the nutritive processes. In the
endeavour to pay due attention to both these factors
Lehmann has been led to this conclusion: “Pleasure
and pain may in all cases be assumed to be the psychical
outcome of the relation between the consumption of
energy which at a given moment is demanded from the
organs, and the supply of energy which is afforded by
nutrition.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In the course of a lengthy and laborious
investigation Marshall has arrived at a very similar
result: “Pleasure and pain are determined by the
relation between the energy given out and the energy
received at any given moment by the physical organs
which determine the content of that moment.” Pleasure
is experienced, according to Marshall’s definition, whenever
a surplus of stored energy is discharged in the
reaction to the stimulus; pain is experienced whenever
a stimulus claims a greater development of energy
in the reaction than the organ is capable of affording.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>In this mode of treatment due attention is paid to
those theories according to which the conditions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
pleasure are to be sought, not in expenditure of force,
but in the receiving of force or in the recovery of
balance.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But though this point has its own importance,
it cannot by any means be put on a level with the
dynamic aspect. Pleasure <i>can never arise</i> when the
organs are not well-nourished, strong, and capable of
function; but it arises only <i>on the condition</i> that they
actually do perform a function. As Marshall has
rightly remarked, there is no reason to believe that
surplus of vigour and receipt of nourishment in themselves
could ever be objects of consciousness.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> As long
as we can speak of mental states, these must be
accompanied by corresponding activities. The chief
merit of Marshall’s thesis is precisely this, that every
emotional state, independently of its tone and of its
perceptible manifestations, can be interpreted in terms
of activity. Pleasure, acute or massive, appears as the
result of a stimulus, which, owing to a happy proportion
between its intensity and the functional capacity of the
organ, has modified the bodily functions in such a way
as to produce manifestations of energy. Pain, acute or
massive, appears as the result of a stimulus, possibly of
the same kind, which, owing to a disproportion arising
from its own greater intensity or the smaller functional
capacity in the organ, has called forth a functional
inhibition—that is to say, that kind of activity which
is manifested to us as an arrest of energy.</p>

<p>It would be too sanguine to expect the real nature of
pleasure and pain to be exhaustively defined in any
formula such as the above. From a theoretical point of
view grave objections may undoubtedly be raised against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Marshall’s theory as well as against every general interpretation
of emotional states. It may even be admitted,
and we desire to admit it as soon as possible, that in
several cases it seems extremely difficult to derive the
feeling-tone of even the simplest sensations from the
proportion between “energy given out and energy
received.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> But since, as far as we can see, similar
difficulties meet us in the application of every existing
emotional theory, for the present we must consider
the constructions of Mr. Marshall, notwithstanding
their speculative and necessarily unsafe character,
as affording us the most consistent explanation
of the hedonic phenomena. In an earlier work,
<cite>Förstudier till en konstfilosofi</cite> (A Preliminary Study
for a Philosophy of Art), I have tried to discuss and
refute some of the arguments which can be adduced
against this theory. In the present work such a theoretic
digression would lead us too far away from the main
subject. For a right understanding of the relation
between feeling and “expressional” movements it is not
necessary, we believe, to adopt exclusively any one of
the emotional theories. We shall be quite content if it
is admitted that Mr. Marshall’s interpretation affords
us a scheme or formula by the aid of which we can
account, if not for the nature, at least for the external
manifestations of our feelings.</p>

<p>In applying his definitions to the various kinds of
pleasure and pain, Mr. Marshall has recourse to three
important principles, viz. the limited amount of energy
which our system is capable of developing at any given
moment, the storage of surplus supplies of nourishment,
and the transference of energy from one organ to another.
By referring to these principles he has been able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
bring under his explanation those feelings which seem
to correspond not to “activities,” but to “states.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>As is well known, Hamilton had already pointed out
the important, though unsuspected, element of activity
which is involved in our enjoyment of <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i>.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
But with the physiology at his command he could
scarcely have explained why rest after heavy work is
always accompanied by eminently pleasurable feelings.
If it be assumed, however, that in the case of psychical
effort, <i>e.g.</i>, the call upon our limited fund of energy has
reduced the vegetative functions to inactivity, and that
this inactivity has caused a storage of nutritive supply,
then it is self-evident that the vegetative functions, as
soon as the one-sided effort has ceased, must discharge
their surplus in movements of a pleasurable character.</p>

<p>The pain arising from restricted activity can equally
be explained in terms of movement. If we believe that
our system has a limited amount of energy which—as
long as life is maintained—must necessarily be active
in some direction or other, then we shall also understand
that anything which closes the natural and usual
outlet of this energy will give rise to activities in related
organs, the nutritive state of which does not present the
conditions of pleasurable function. Mr. Marshall has
tried to indicate the details of the transition by which
inactivity in one organ causes excessive activity in other
organs. His description of the “gorging of the nutritive
channels,” “the calling for aid of the disabled
elements,” etc., is, however, too figurative and poetical
to be of any importance in a psychological argument.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Taken as a vague and necessarily coarse metaphor,
this physiological image may, however, illustrate a
process which perhaps can never be exactly analysed,
but which is nevertheless familiar to everybody.
No one who has experienced in any higher degree the
diffused sensation of gnawing inactivity can doubt
the active element in this corroding feeling. One
seems to feel how the checked and thwarted impulses
devouringly turn themselves inward. Poetical literature
is full of passionate outcries against the tortures which
imposed inaction inflicts on active spirits; and modern
autobiographies give us pathetic examples of the sufferings
of those whose intellectual activity has been
diverted from outward aims to internal analysis. The
candid confessions of Amiel and Kierkegaard show the
inevitable necessity with which mental energy, if arrested
in its natural course, finds itself an outlet in destructive
activity. This truth had already been expressed in
simple and drastic form in Logau’s old epigram:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ein Mühlstein und ein Menschenherz wird stets herumgetrieben.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wenn beides nicht zu reiben hat, wird beides selbst zerrieben.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The displacement of mental attention corresponding
to the transference of energy from one organ to
another in the inevitable search for a channel of
outlet causes arrested activity to be felt as an unbearable
massive pain; but this process implies at the same
time a possibility of relief. If the sufferings of restriction
can be considered as brought about by arrested
impulses which have turned inwards, then it is evident
that any outward activity may overcome the obstruction.
Pleasure can perhaps not be achieved before the checked
organ resumes its functions; but even a vicarious activity
in some related organ may relieve the pain. Hence the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
diffused, undirected movements by which we instinctively
try to get rid of a feeling of restriction. Every high-strung
emotional state which has not yet found its appropriate
expression affords an instance of this sensation.
Exalted delight therefore often manifests itself in ecstatic
dances and songs, which, properly speaking, rather relieve
an incipient pain than express a pleasure. Violent
movements act as unconscious expedients by which the
organism restores itself to its normal balance.</p>

<p>A similar instinct ought, one would expect, to operate
in sensations of acute pain. In point of fact, an obscure
consciousness of the limitation of functional energy, or,
to put it in psychological terms, of attentive power,
leads us to seek and find relief from pain in violent
movement. Some of the frantic dances of savage tribes
undoubtedly serve to deaden the sufferings inflicted by
ritual tortures. But it is, of course, only in exceptional
cases that these anæsthetic expedients are intentionally
resorted to. As a rule they are to be considered as a
radiation of nervous tension, and are so little conscious
that we can scarcely even call them instinctive. Besides
all the motor manifestations which thus follow upon a
sensation of severe pain in almost direct physiological
sequence, some pantomimic activity of defence or avoidance
will generally be called forth by the notion of an
objective source of pain. Owing to associations derived
from earlier similar states, this reaction may often appear
even when there is no definite object which can be
assigned as the cause of the feeling. Among primitive
people the pantomime of pain undoubtedly has its ground
in a mythological conception of the nature of feeling.
Pain is regarded as a concrete thing which the body
may be capable of shaking off or avoiding. Crude as it
may seem, this illusion is so closely bound up with our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
instinctive reactions that even the most enlightened man
can never completely emancipate himself from its influence.
There is thus nearly always an intellectual
factor which co-operates with the physical tendency
towards energetic reaction to pain.</p>

<p>Thus pain, notwithstanding its inhibitive character,
may act, especially when it is acute, as a motor incitement.
Hence the curious cases of favourable medical
effects produced by severe physical suffering, which may
serve not only as a distraction of the attention, but also
as a positive stimulation of sinking vitality. Hence
also the enhanced intellectual activity which often
follows upon pain.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> There was perhaps more malignity
than truth in the remark of Michelet that Flaubert
might imperil his talent by curing his boils;<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> but there
are unquestionable instances to prove that wounds
and acute diseases have exercised a powerful exciting
influence on certain artistic temperaments.</p>

<p>All these stimulating effects of pain must naturally
be taken into account in every emotional theory. But
they can by no means be adduced, as Fechner thinks,
as an argument against the definition which we have
already given.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Reactions to pain follow, indeed,
so immediately upon the sensation, that they cannot
be separated in time from its proper expression. But
it must always be remembered that the activities,
whether of writhing under the influence of pain or of
combating it, are secondary manifestations by which
the feeling-tone is gradually weakened. Whether the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
stimulating effects appear at the very moment of impression
or only when the sensation has become fully
conscious, pain is always, we believe, at its keenest
when the outward development of energy is lowest. If
the notion “expression” is conceived in its strictest
sense, <i>i.e.</i> as the physiological counterpart of the
emotional state, then pain has only one expression—inhibition.</p>

<p>With regard to states of pleasure it is more difficult
to make any distinction between primary and secondary
manifestations. Every new movement is a new expression
of the same feeling which—as long as fatigue does
not set up its peculiar pain—is only enhanced by these
repeated “somatic resonances.” If pleasure is originated
by the increased function of one individual organ, then
this stimulation must, owing to the solidarity of the
functions, gradually extend over wider areas in the
system. The more numerous the organs which take
part in the activity, the more numerous also are our
sensations of function, and the greater the gain of our
pleasure in richness and variety. An undefined feeling
of vigour, assurance, or power can only acquire distinctness
and intensity by expressing itself in some mode of
physical or mental activity. But while stimulation is
thus directly connected with the feeling-tone of pleasurable
states, it must be admitted, on the other hand, that—as
has been remarked above—associative influences
also contribute towards enhancing their active manifestations.
By these secondary motor-impulses, however,
the original feeling is only increased. It can therefore
be said that pleasure feeds and nurtures itself by
expression. Pain, on the contrary, increases in strength
in the same degree as the inhibition extends over the
organism. But it can only be weakened by active<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
manifestations. Movements, as we have shown, deliver
us from the massive, indistinct pains of restriction as
well as mitigate our acute sufferings.</p>

<p>The life-preserving tendency which, under the feeling
of pleasure, leads us to movements which intensify the
sensation and make it more distinct for consciousness,
compels us in pain to seek for relief and deliverance in
violent motor discharge. In either case the activity is
called expressional, and it seems difficult to avoid this
equivocal usage. But it is indispensable to make a
strict distinction between the expression which operates
in the direction of the initial feeling itself, and the
expression by which this feeling is weakened.</p>

<p>This distinction will appear with greater clearness in
the following chapter, where we shall apply the laws of
expression to the complex emotional states. Then it
will also be possible for us to point out some æsthetic
result of the psychological survey which perhaps may
seem for the moment a departure from our proper
subject.</p>

<small>THE EMOTIONS</small></h2></div>


<p>The discussion of complex emotional states on which
we enter in the present chapter will be subject to the
same reservation as was our previous discussion of
simple sensation-feeling. It is not proposed to attempt
a definitive explanation of the <i>nature</i> of emotion, nor
even to criticise the various emotion-theories which
have been advanced in psychological literature. For
the purposes of an æsthetic investigation we are only
concerned with the external aspects, the outward manifestations,
of mental states. We need not therefore
dilate upon the controversies as to the exact relation
between simple feeling and emotion. It is enough for
us that all authors—those who consider pain and
pleasure as elements <i>sui generis</i> as well as those who
count them among sensations or emotions—agree in
emphasising the prominent hedonic element which
enters into all our emotions. Starting from this universally
recognised fact, we shall try to explain the impulse
to expression, as it appears in complex emotions, by the
same laws which we deduced from an examination of
simple hedonic states.</p>

<p>The legitimacy of such a course will scarcely be
contested by any one who admits the vital and necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
connection between emotional states and movement-sensations.
And in point of fact, this connection does
not seem to be denied by many modern psychologists.
There is indeed much controversy as to the best mode
of formulating the well-known theory due to James and
Lange, and there is also much to discuss in its general
theoretic aspect. But the observation on which this
theory was based by James, viz. that it is impossible
for us to imagine any emotion which is not connected
with feelings of bodily symptoms, seems nowadays to
be pretty safe against attack. Before and after James,
the fundamental importance of bodily changes has been
acknowledged by almost all authors who have specially
studied the emotional states. We need only refer to
Bain, Ribot, Féré, Paulhan, and Godfernaux.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Even
Professor Stout, who on general grounds takes exception
to the views of James, leaves unassailed the thesis from
which the latter starts in his chapter on the emotions.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
And it is even somewhat superfluous to adduce all these
authorities in support of a fact which must have been
noted by every one who pays any attention to his own
mental states. We never experience any intense
emotion, such as fear, anger, or sorrow, without at the
same time experiencing some distinct sensation of change
in our functions of respiration and circulation, as well
as in the activities of our voluntary muscles. In the
case of emotions of slight intensity, where no changes
of this character are perceptible, we are justified in
assuming that they do nevertheless occur, only on a
much smaller scale, and possibly in different organs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
The clinical and experimental researches of medical
science, as well as experiments undertaken in psychological
laboratories, tend to prove that all ideas, even of
the most abstract kind, are accompanied by modifications
of organic activity, similar to, but weaker than,
those which accompany the simple sensations. It is
only natural, therefore, to conclude that the feeling-element
in emotions and sentiments, as well as in simple
pain and pleasure, is correlated with the quality—stimulating
or inhibitive—and intensity of these modifications.
All hedonic states, whether called forth directly by a
simple physiological stimulus, or indirectly by the
mediation of perceptions, memories, and ideas, can thus,
in so far as they are feelings, be considered as essentially
alike. The complete emotion, such as joy or anger,
with all its elements of thought and conscious or
unconscious volition, is of course something quite
different from the simple feeling-tone of mere pleasure
or pain. Physiological psychology does not, as its
opponents maintain, assimilate gratifications of the
sense of taste to æsthetic enjoyment or religious
exaltation. We allow <i>rank</i> to a sentiment in virtue of
the mental conceptions by which it is justified in the
breast of the person who feels it. But the <i>strength</i> of
such a sentiment, <i>as feeling</i>, we deem to be proportioned
to the organic changes by which enthusiasm and
devotion, just as much as sensual pleasure, are always
accompanied. We do not assert that these organic
changes are always identical in kind. In the simplest
forms of hedonic sensation—sensation proper—they
have their main equivalent in changes of the vegetative
functions; in the emotions they are accompanied by
movements of our voluntary muscles; and in the sentiments
they may correspond to an activity which takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
place chiefly in the organ of thought. And from these
differences arise other important differences in duration
as well as in intensity of the pleasure-pain. But all
these various limitations cannot modify the essential
fact, which is, that pleasure is always connected with an
enhancement, and pain with a depression, of the vital
functions.</p>

<p>For a satisfactory explanation of our emotions it
would no doubt be desirable to have all the complicated
physiological concomitants reduced to simple terms of
functional enhancement and functional arrest. Such a
reduction can, however, be undertaken only in a few
favourable cases. We can easily see, for instance, that
in pride and humiliation a series of perceptions and
ideas have brought about conditions of facilitated and
checked activity similar to those which, in sensational
pleasure-pain, are created by simple physiological
stimuli.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> We may also agree with Lehmann when he
endeavours to prove that the pain a child experiences
when its mother leaves its bedside can be reduced to a
sensation of arrested activity.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> And we may in the
same way explain our own feelings after losses which,
from our point of view, are more serious, as largely due
to the fact that an occasion of activity for our senses,
thoughts, or bodily powers has been suddenly withdrawn.
But it would be too laborious to enter upon
such an analysis of all our compound emotions, and it is
also superfluous. Even when the organic conditions of
pleasure and pain cannot be detected among the intricate
mass of intellectual and volitional elements which
make up what we can observe of an emotion, we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
still, from analogy, conclude that some kind of functional
enhancement or arrest corresponds to the feeling-tone.</p>

<p>Seeing, then, that what we may call “pure feeling”
remains the same in all possible combinations, we must
expect to meet with the same phenomena in connection
with the manifestations of the higher emotions and
sentiments, as those already described in case of simple
pain or pleasure. It is true that in fully formed anger,
joy, contempt, and so on, the tendency to expression
for expression’s sake—as when a child laughs or dances
for mere joy—is seldom found pure and unmixed. But
even in such complex states we may in the abstract
distinguish the impulse directly and inherently connected
with the physiological change—the impulse which tends
<i>automatically</i> to bring out the tone of pleasure with
more prominence or to relieve the tone of pain—from all
the conscious and volitional activities by which the
external cause of the feeling is either approached or
avoided. We have only to remember that, as was the
case with sensation-feelings, those intentional movements
which are directly or by virtue of association
connected with an emotion will always work in the
same direction as the purely automatic expression.</p>

<p>With regard to anger, for instance, we can in theory,
at all events, distinguish the activity which follows
as a purely physiological reaction upon the initial
inhibition, and which therefore is quite undirected by
any idea of attacking an enemy, from the conscious
reaction by which we strive with all our powers to overcome
and annihilate a real or imaginary foe. But we
know that both these kinds of expression produce similar
mental effects. Whether we concentrate our attention
on the element of pure feeling and its accompanying
activities, or on the intermixture of intellectual and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
volitional elements by which the emotion is distinguished
from simple pleasure-pain, we shall thus find
that active manifestations always enhance the positive
tone of feeling, which is in itself the counterpart of a
functional enhancement, and relieve the negative tone,
which is the counterpart of functional arrest.</p>

<p>To prove this assertion with regard to all the
different emotions would mean an unnecessary repetition
of the arguments adduced in the preceding chapter.
We need therefore only dwell on a few individual
cases in which the effects of expression, owing to the
complex nature of all fully developed emotions, are
subject to misinterpretation. It has, for instance, often
been contended in psychological literature that pleasurable
emotions lose in strength in the same degree as
they are expressed. Mr. Spencer, who finds the
physiological basis of all emotion in nervous tension,
has tried to prove that joy is always strongest when
most restrained. But the argument he adduces is by no
means unimpeachable. He says that people who show
the finest appreciation of humour are often capable of
saying and doing the most laughable things with the
utmost gravity.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> In this instance joy has, however,
been confounded with the sense of the comic, which is
of course a purely intellectual gift, and which does not
even presuppose a cheerful disposition. The less the
expenditure of nervous force on outward activity, the
greater is the efficiency with which the work of thought
can be carried on.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> There is thus a physiological reason
why he who laughs least utters the best jokes. But all
the fools whose mouths overflow with laughter (<i lang="la">risus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
abundat in ore stultorum</i>) may no doubt often be
happier than the most talented humourist. No sane
man would say that Swift was happy.</p>

<p>It is, however, undeniable that even joy gradually
decreases if it is allowed an unimpeded outlet. But
that is often a result of bodily fatigue, which makes
thought as well as feeling impossible. Pleasure may
also increase <i>qua</i> feeling, if its most outward manifestations
are controlled. But hereby the activity has only,
as Spencer himself remarks, been directed into new
channels.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The motor impulses reflect themselves inwards
and accumulate when their outlet is stopped.
From bodily movements, which are its simplest and
most natural expression, joy may thus be diverted into
the region of thought. When a savage has attained so
high a state of development as to be able to control the
impulse to dance and yell for joy, the first dithyramb
has been composed.</p>

<p>It is impossible for us to estimate the relative
importance of internal and external activity. All we
can say is that a joy, the outward expressions of which
are controlled, probably gains in durability. But on
the other hand it is possible that a joy which has been
allowed a free discharge, in the very moment of expression
is stronger <i>qua</i> feeling. If the motor impulses
find no outlet in any direction, the emotional state will,
as has already been pointed out, become more and more
affected with elements of pain.</p>

<p>When the physiological counterpart of an emotion
takes the form of an inhibition, the feeling-tone will
of course gain in intensity in the same degree as
wider and wider areas of activity come under the
influence of the arrest. This law can also be observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
in the course of development of all pain-emotions.
Sorrow, despair, humiliation, and so on, are relatively
mild as long as the inhibition is restricted to
the voluntary muscles. They acquire their full and
proper strength as feeling only when the involuntary
activities take part in the functional disturbance.
And we can often notice in ourselves how, in the same
degree as a painful emotion increases, the inhibition
cuts its way deeper and deeper into the organism.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Humiliation, which of all emotions is the most hopelessly
and irredeemably painful, is in its higher degrees always
accompanied by functional changes which make themselves
felt even in our digestive organs. Literature, to
which in questions of emotional psychology we must
apply for the information which no experiment can
supply, proves that it is hard to swallow. It has a
bitter taste, and is sickening even in purely physical
sense.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The greatest grief, on the other hand, that man
has been able to imagine manifests itself physiologically
as a complete internal as well as external paralysis, such
as is suggested by the Greek myth of the sorrowing
mother turned into stone.</p>

<p>The progress of functional inhibition from organ to
organ and the accompanying increase of the pain-emotion
does of course generally take place without
the co-operation of volition. But the increase of an
incipient pain-sentiment can also be facilitated by
voluntary efforts. As Professor James remarks, we
may effectively strengthen a mood of sadness if we only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
consistently arrest the activity of all the organs which
are under the control of our will.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> And it is well known
that much is possible in the way of working up feelings
of melancholy. It may seem somewhat strange that
the cultivation of such painful states has attained so
high a development in man. But the apparent paradox
is solved if we direct our attention to the secondary
tones of pleasure which can always be derived from
artificial moods of suffering. Sentimental reflection is
able to extract from them a peculiar satisfaction which
is highly appreciated by certain temperaments. We
need only refer to the literature of romanticism, which
gives us most instructive instances of pride in sensibility.
Another kind of enjoyment is attained when persons
who consider themselves unfairly treated by cruel
fortune deliberately feed upon their own sufferings.
As Spencer has shrewdly pointed out, they will infallibly
derive a pleasurable sensation of their own value
when contrasting their fate with the happiness which
they consider their due.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Melancholy people, on the
other hand, may perhaps be inclined to make themselves
as helpless and unfortunate as possible for the sake of
experiencing both sides of that “love of the helpless”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
which, according to Spencer, is the most primordial
form of altruistic feeling. The expressions and
pantomimes of sadness often strike us as a kind of
self-caressing in which the sufferer, by division of his
own personality, enjoys the double pleasure of giving
and receiving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>According to the most consistent terminology, this
tendency to enhance feeling by voluntary co-operation
with functional inhibition ought perhaps to be considered
as the characteristic expression of painful
emotion. It is, however, as has already been pointed
out in our treatment of sensation-feeling, more in
conformity with ordinary usage—and also with etymology—to
apply the word expression to those active,
outward manifestations by which the inhibition is
relieved. There can be no inconvenience in doing so
if we only keep constantly in mind the distinction
between the expression which enhances and the expression
which relieves. As long as these two notions
are confounded, a consistent explanation of emotional
states is quite impossible. The contradictions in Professor
James’ brilliant chapter on the emotions furnish
us with a ready proof of this impossibility. If he had
based his theory upon a close discrimination of either
class of expression, as they can be distinguished in
simple sensational feeling, he would probably not have
contended that sorrow is increased by sobbing,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> while
admitting in another passage that “dry and shrunken
sorrow” is more painful than any “crying fit.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>It is, however, impossible to deny that sighing,
sobbing, twisting the hands, and other active manifestations
are often effectively used, by actors, for
example, as means for working up despair or sorrows.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
But it seems to us indubitable that these movements
when they succeed in creating the real feeling do so
by help of association. A pain-emotion which has been
called into existence by such dramatic mechanism is
therefore seldom quite genuine. Real sorrow, hate,
or anger, as pain-feelings, are on their physiological
side much more deeply seated than these surface
expressions, which, properly speaking, are merely a
reproduction of the usual reactions upon the primary
feeling. They are therefore not to be easily stirred up
by aid of mimetic action.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be contended that these remarks
apply only to the artificial creation of pain-emotion.
When under the sway of veritable sorrow we undoubtedly
feel as if the mental state were really
intensified during its expression by the direct influence
of the muscular activities, which constitute the sighing,
sobbing, or crying. As far as the compound emotion
is concerned, this observation is unquestionably correct.
Sorrow, with all its intellectual and volitional elements,
may become more distinct for consciousness the more
it is actively expressed. But the pain itself, which
constitutes the primary and initial state of this emotion,
has by no means been increased. On the contrary, a
crying fit, for instance, as even Professor James admits,
may be accompanied by a kind of excitement which has
a peculiar tone of pungent pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>The same process can be observed in the course of all
the so-called pain-emotions. During active expression,
while the general mental state increases in definiteness,
the purely “algedonic” element of pain is gradually
weakened or changed. Anger, which begins with an
inhibition and a vascular contraction, to which,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> on the
mental side, corresponds a feeling of intense pain, is
thus in its active stage a decidedly pleasurable emotion.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Fear, which in its initial stage is paralysing and depressing,
often changes in tone when the first shock has
been relieved by motor reaction.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> And to some extent
the same may be said even of despair. In every
pain-emotion where there is a development of active
energy involved in the reaction upon the initial feeling,
the tone of this feeling is apt to undergo some change
owing to the influence of this activity.</p>

<p>This circumstance explains why expression for
expression’s sake as a life-preserving principle occupies
so important a place in the life of man. But it also
accounts for another phenomenon which, although not
directly connected with the expressional impulse, is
æsthetically so important that it cannot properly be
passed over in this work. We refer to the apparent
paradox that anger, fear, sorrow, notwithstanding their
distinctly painful initial stage, are often not only not
avoided, but even deliberately sought. Taken in connection
with those perhaps even more curious cases,
in which sensation-feelings of pain are intentionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
provoked, this apparent inversion of the normal course
constitutes one of the most important problems in
emotional psychology. The question of such “luxuries
of grief,” or, to use a more appropriate German phrase,
“Die Wonne des Leids,” is, however, so complicated
that its treatment will require a chapter to itself.</p>

<small>THE ENJOYMENT OF PAIN</small></h2></div>


<p>We have pointed out that enjoyment can be derived by
sentimental reflection on moods of sadness. Such
refined forms of the “luxury of grief” presuppose a
certain intellectual development and a tendency to
introspection, which cannot possibly be assumed in
primitive man. But as the active forms of the so-called
pain-emotions are highly appreciated—we may
even say indulged in as enjoyments—by the lower tribes
of man, there must evidently be some more immediate
cause of this delight. And we are the more tempted to
look for this cause in the emotional process itself, by the
fact that even bodily pains, which do not admit of any
sentimental interpretation, may be deliberately excited.</p>

<p>We remarked in our treatment of the simple
emotional elements, that pleasure and pain can in no
case be estimated by any absolute measure. Now that
we have to find some explanation of the delight in pain,
which applies to purely physical as well as to mental
pain, we begin by admitting that the relative character
of feeling probably accounts for many instances in which
the pain is merely apparent. The same external stimulus
which acts on one individual with hypernormal strength,
and therefore evokes pain, may in the case of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
individual who has duller senses, produce a weaker
impression, and thus call forth a pleasurable reaction.
The taste and smell anomalies of hysterical patients
afford us good examples of such abnormal pleasure. And,
on the other hand, there are plenty of instances, too
familiar to be enumerated, in which an impression which
a sick person would call painful brings pleasure to a
healthy one.</p>

<p>Again, the power of receiving pleasurable sensations
from strong stimuli may often be increased by exercise.
Mr. Marshall has applied his psycho-physiological
principles to the interpretation of these “acquired
pleasure-gettings” and though he perhaps does not
exhaustively and convincingly explain the process, he at
least gives a graphic and clear account of its most
probable course. He thinks that a hypernormal stimulus
indirectly increases the blood-supply to the stimulated
organ. This organ will therefore, if the operation of the
stimulus is not too prolonged, store up some portion of
unused nutritive force during the subsequent repose.
And thus, if the same stimulus is shortly afterwards
repeated, the organ will be able to respond with greater
facility and intensity, <i>i.e.</i> react under the conditions of
pleasurable reaction. In this way Marshall accounts for
the classic instances of acquired liking for olives and
tobacco.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that a similar influence of repeated
exercise may also operate in the department of compound
emotions. Lehmann, who explains the transformation
of originally painful impressions into pleasurable ones in
a somewhat different way, viz. by his law of “the indispensability
of accustomed things” refers to this law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
those instances in which persons who have had many
troubles grow so accustomed to them, that in a moment
of ease they feel a kind of loss.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The validity of this
law will be recognised by every one who has any
opportunity of observing the vaguely and weakly unpleasant
feeling which sometimes appears when we are
suddenly liberated from some pursuing anxiety. And
the indispensability of accustomed sensations may impel
persons to create new mental pains or worries to replace
the old ones.</p>

<p>Yet the mere craving for customary sensations cannot
explain those cases of genuine luxury in grief in
which pain-sensations and pain-emotions are sought
precisely because they are painful. But if we take into
account the powerful stimulating effect which is
produced by acute pain, we may easily understand why
people submit to momentary unpleasantness for the sake
of enjoying the subsequent excitement. This motive
leads to the deliberate creation not only of pain-sensations,
but also of emotions in which pain enters as an element.
The violent activity which is involved in the reaction
against fear, and still more in that against anger, affords
us a sensation of pleasurable excitement which is well
worth the cost of the passing unpleasantness. It is,
moreover, notorious that some persons have developed a
peculiar art of making the initial pain of anger so
transient that they can enjoy the active elements in
it with almost undivided delight. Such an accomplishment
is far more difficult in the case of sorrow. The
reactions are here seldom allowed so free a course as to
be able to change the feeling-tone of the state. Moreover,
the remembrance of the objective cause will always
tend to reawaken the original feeling with its accom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>panying
inhibition. Besides, a man of culture and
refinement is generally deterred by a kind of respect for
his own emotional life from artificially stirring up states
of sorrow for his own enjoyment. This reluctance,
however, does not seem to exist in lower stages of
development. The crying feasts of the Maoris and the
Todas—which afford a striking parallel to the ceremonial
wailings of ancient Greece—are no doubt, whatever their
ritual significance may be, attended with a kind of
pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> By seizing on some real or fictitious cause for
grief—the death of a Linos or an Adonis—the participants
succeed, we imagine, in creating a state of sorrow
in which the active and stimulating elements outweigh
the pain.</p>

<p>However barbarous this kind of amusement may
seem to us, it is by no means certain that we have
completely outgrown such pleasures. The delight in
witnessing the performance of a tragedy undoubtedly
involves the enjoyment of a borrowed pain, which, by
unconscious sympathetic imitation, we make partially
our own.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> And the same phenomenon appears in a yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
cruder form in the custom, so general among the lower
classes of most countries, of visiting funerals and similar
ceremonies where sorrow can be contemplated and
shared. Even civilised man is thus able to enjoy the
pleasure which may be connected with emotions of
sorrow and despair, at least in second-hand reproduction.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to go through all the various
emotional states in order to prove that every one of them,
if it can <i>per se</i> be enjoyed (in nature or art), is either
primarily or by its reactions connected with an increase
of outward activity. But we must point out that the
pleasure derived from this motor excitement is often
still further enhanced by the agency of an intellectual
element which is simpler than sentimental reflection, and
does not presuppose any tendency towards introspection.
In pain as in pleasure, in suffering as in voluptuousness,
we attain a heightened and enriched sensation of life.
The more we love life, the more must we also enjoy this
sensation, even if it be called into existence by pain.
Lessing, who cannot possibly be called morbid, confesses
to this taste in an interesting letter written to Mendelssohn:
“Darinn sind wir doch wohl einig, l.F., dass alle
Leidenschaften entweder heftige Begierden oder heftige
Verabscheuengen sind? Auch darinn: dass wir uns bei
jeder heftigen Begierde oder Verabscheuung, eines
grösser Grads unserer Realität bewusst sind und dass
dieses Bewusstsein nicht anders als angenehm sein kann?
Folglich sind alle Leidenschaften, auch die allerunangenehmsten,
als Leidenschaften angenehm.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> (“We are
agreed in this, my dear friend, that all passions are either
vehement cravings or vehement loathings, and also that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
in every vehement craving or loathing we acquire an
increased consciousness of our reality, and that this
consciousness cannot but be pleasurable. Consequently,
all our passions, even the most painful, are, as passions,
pleasurable.”) And Helvetius has expressed almost the
same idea: “Nous souhaiterons donc, par des impressions
toujours nouvelles, être à chaque instant avertis de notre
existence, parceque chacun de ces avertissements est
pour nous un plaisir.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> (“Accordingly, we shall desire,
by means of constantly renewed impressions, to be at
every moment reminded of our existence, because
each of these reminders is for us a pleasure.”) For the
sake of this “avertissement” of existence, individuals
of intense vital temperament, like Richard Jefferies
and Maryia Bashkirtseff, have positively loved their
very sufferings.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that pain as a sign of life and function
may be especially welcome when the vital sensation has
for any reason become weakened. The self-woundings
of the heathen and Christian saints, although no doubt
fully justified to the sufferers themselves by religious
motives, may thus have had their innermost unconscious
motive in an endeavour to overcome that anæsthesia
which is so usual an accompaniment of hysterical
disturbances.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> It is hard to believe that the tortures
which they inflict upon themselves are really felt as
neutral or pleasurable. But we can easily understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
that such torture, although more or less painful, may
afford a kind of satisfaction by compelling the slow and
dull senses to function. Professor Lange has in his work
on the emotions laid special stress upon this point. “It
is a condition of our well-being,” he says, “that our
sensorial centres should be in a certain degree of
activity called forth by the impressions which reach
them through the sensorial nerves from the outside. If
from some cause or other—for instance, from a decrease
in the functional powers of these centres—there arises
an insensibility, anæsthesia, then we feel a longing to
force them to their usual activity by addressing to them
an abnormally strong appeal, or, in other words, by
intensifying the external impressions and thereby
neutralising the insensibility.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> This principle has,
indeed, as applied by Lange to the expressions of anger,
been mercilessly ridiculed by Wundt.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> But it seems to
us that the observation itself can scarcely be contested.
Whether we explain it as a case of the indispensability
of the accustomed or as the result of some peculiar
yearning for life—a soul-desire, as Mr. Jefferies would
have called it—a deficient consciousness of function is
in most cases distinctly unpleasant. And, on the other
hand, it seems as if an increased consciousness of
function were <i>per se</i> pleasurable. It is of course
difficult to prove by exact argument the existence of a
feeling which can be observed only as the innermost
concealed motive of our life. But on as strong evidence
as can ever be adduced on matters of emotional life, we
may believe that in every conscious life there operates a
dim instinctive craving for fuller and greater conscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>ness,
or, if the expression be preferred, for the most
complete self-realisation. Happiness itself has been
defined by a philosopher so little inclined to mysticism
as Mr. Brinton, as “the increasing consciousness of
self.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> It is therefore easy to understand why, when
this consciousness has been blunted by some cause or
other, we may even long for suffering and pain as a
means of escaping the dulness, emptiness, and darkness
of insensibility. It may seem to be a disturbance of
all normal instincts that pain—an element hostile to
vital activity—can thus be preferred to a state the
unpleasantness of which is only diffuse. But we have
to remember that the absence of sensation and function
frightens us by its similarity to what we fear more than
pain.</p>

<p>The sufferings of insensibility, this highest possible
form of tedium, which—if we are to judge from the
descriptions in literature and poetry—may in themselves
be unbearable enough, must needs be unusually keen in
individuals who are given up to philosophic reflection.
The feeling of inanity which is caused by a suspense of
vital sensations is apt to spread itself over the whole
field of sense-experience.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In default of strong impressions,
with their subsequent reactions, we may lose
the sense not only of our own existence, but also of
that of the external world.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The relatively neutral
evidence of our higher senses does not afford us the
same assurance of reality as is given by grosser
impressions, which affect us more directly in the way of
pleasure or pain. On purely physiological grounds
there may thus be produced a morbid conception of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
universe which, having neither ego nor non-ego to rely
on, lacks the conviction either of subjective or objective
existence. From this vertiginous inanity, which must
bring every philosophic temperament into despair, life
delivers us by the same means which Molière uses to
confute the Pyrrhonists. Pain is the most convincing
reality we can imagine. It may therefore, even when it
is not deliberately sought for, afford a welcome support
to thought.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this connection, however, we have not to dwell
on the philosophical importance of pain. We are here
only concerned with its significance for the immediate
sense of life. And in this respect we believe that an
artificial creation of pain may play some part not only
in anger, but in the expression of all high-strung
emotions. It is well known that the orgiastic state of
mind, whether originally caused by religious exaltation
or by erotic delirium, may often, when it has reached its
highest stage, express itself in self-laceration. These
facts are no doubt difficult to interpret. But it seems
justifiable to assume that a tendency towards the
creating of pain-sensations may have been derived from
the emotional process itself. Explained in this way,
orgiastic self-tortures may be adduced as the most
remarkable proofs of this desire for an enhanced sense
of life which lies at the bottom of all our appetence.</p>

<p>However energetically strong emotions may accentuate
our existence, and however deeply we may enjoy the
“realisation of ourselves” which we find in the violent
excitement accompanying them, high-strung states are
naturally bound to be followed by exhaustion and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
stupor. And thus even the intoxication of life, this
most powerful of sensations, sooner or later passes its
climax and sinks into dull insensibility. The lower the
function by the incitement of which the exaltation is
produced, the greater probably is its orgiastic power.
But its duration is also so much the shorter. A wild
dance, for instance, invariably ends in impotent prostration,
during which the power of function and sensation is
completely exhausted. As long as the mental desire for
increased excitement is unsatisfied, this state must be
distinctly disagreeable. Hence all the frenetic manifestations
by which man, when raging in insatiable
exaltation, strives to awake and rouse his failing powers
of enjoyment.</p>

<p>In the whole domain of comparative psychology
there can scarcely be adduced an example which throws
so much light on the orgiastic state of mind as the
Bacchanal frenzy. And the descriptions of this
“Dionysischer Zustand” which are to be found in
classic literature give us the most complete idea of the
various expedients by which the devotee tries to
maintain and increase his state of exaltation in spite of
the growing tendency to relaxation. By noise, roaring,
and loud cries, by frenetic dance and wild actions, the
“Maenads” strive to preserve and recover the fading
sense of life, which ever baffles their exertions. And as
the last, infallible means of excitement, resorted to
when all other stimulations have proved unable to stir
up the dulled senses, we may explain the tortures
which the partly insensible Bacchante inflicts upon
herself. “Suum Bacchis non sentit saucia vulnus.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>There are various kinds of orgiastic exaltation con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>nected
with self-torture—as that of the tarantella
dancers, of the dervishes, of the shamans, and others—in
which the creation of pain-sensations may be explained
as a desperate device for enhancing the intensity of the
emotional state. Acute pain often makes it possible to
overcome momentarily the exhaustion or the dulness
which unfits us for work. And it is evident that pain
may produce a similar excitement when we require an
increase of energy, not for the sake of obtaining the
greatest possible result from a working activity, but for
the sake of extracting the greatest possible enjoyment
out of an emotional state.</p>

<p>But if this interpretation be admitted as possible,
there will be ample room for discussion as to its application
to individual cases. For it is to be remembered
that even pain may fulfil the task of relieving a nervous
tension. In cases of bodily suffering counter irritation
may thus bring about a wholesome diversion of the
attention from an otherwise unbearable pain.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> And it
is unquestionable that self-inflicted lacerations during
violent emotion often subserve the same purpose. When
a savage scarifies himself on receiving bad news, or at a
funeral feast, his action is an instinctive effort to procure
relief from the overpowering feelings.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> That he is not
simply performing a sacrificial rite,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> but is merely seeking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
the relief which experience has taught him may be
afforded by pain as well as by the subsequent exhaustion
(especially from loss of blood), is proved by the fact
that the same expedient is employed in order to overcome
humiliation or bodily pain.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It is not stimulation,
but a lulling of the senses, which is here aimed at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>It must also be admitted that even the other orgiastic
manifestations may serve as purely cathartic means of
relieving emotional pressure. It is, as has already been
remarked, impossible to decide in individual cases
whether an activity of expression—a dance, for instance—serves
to enhance a pleasurable feeling or to relieve a
pain. Suffering, sorrow, and despair may often, in their
outward reactions, borrow the forms of expression which
are usually connected with joy. Thus frenetic games
and dances are often met with on occasions when we
should least of all expect them, as, for instance, in time
of famine, epidemic, or war.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Such paradoxical manifestations,
in which an overstrained despair attempts to
obtain some kind of relief, are externally not to be distinguished
from the genuine expression of joy. On the
other hand, an abnormally strong emotion, which is
primarily caused by the objective conditions of pleasure,
may in its excess be perceived as a pain. Joy itself can
thus be felt as an oppressive burden, which we try with
all our power to get rid of. The motor discharges, by
which we seek relief from such a “Noth der Fülle und
der Überfülle,” can, however, only indirectly offer us any
real deliverance. A wild dance, for instance, will inevitably
accentuate the original feeling as a conscious
state, and thereby increase its intensity. But with
this increase the craving for relief will also become
stronger. As long as expression is unable to satisfy
the ever-growing nervous tension, there must remain
an element of “never enough” in the orgiastic exalta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>tion.
It is only when repeated solicitation has
brought on bodily exhaustion that a real release is
attained.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that such a relief-bringing
exhaustion was the ultimate aim of all those exalted
manifestations to which the poor tarantuli and the Vitus
dancers abandoned themselves. But the problem presented
by the similarity between the pathological despair
which constitutes the initial stage of such epidemic
mental disorders, and the oppressive feeling of joy whose
expression has been thwarted, is so difficult that we can
hardly expect to obtain a decisive answer to such
questions as whether, for example, the mænadic exaltation
is to be considered as a melancholic or a cheerful
state of mind. And in most cases it would probably
be equally impossible to ascertain whether in a
given manifestation we have to do with pleasure that
seeks enhancement, or with pain that seeks relief in
exhaustion.</p>

<p>While every one is thus free to interpret the facts
according to his optimistic or pessimistic bias, it must
nevertheless be considered as a confusion of ideas to
make the quest of unconsciousness a universal and
fundamental impulse in man. It is impossible for us to
assign any psychological importance to commonplaces
on the enviable state of the insensible and the happiness
to be found in unconsciousness. It is only when it
delivers us from pain that a state of partial insensibility
and cessation of function may be perceived as relatively
agreeable. That an absolute absence of feeling could
afford us any pleasure is a psychological contradiction
in terms.</p>

<p>This illusion of unconsciousness can, however, be
easily explained by the fact that intense emotional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
states are generally dominated by a single preoccupation.
A strong feeling, by reason of the limitations of our
consciousness, annihilates external sensations and ideas.
Ecstasy, that “over-conscious” state of highly concentrated
activity, rises above space and time to a state in
which we feel liberated from all forms of perception.
But the highest pleasure which we may thus experience
is not, as Wagner in his pessimistic period would have
it, a sinking and drowning of ourselves in unconsciousness;
it is far rather—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“endlos ewig</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">einbewuszt.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To enjoy so rich and complete a sensation of life
has, we believe, been the object for which, each in his
own manner, all men of strong vitality have striven.
Even if there are individuals so unfortunate that for
them a cessation of life and function appears as the
highest end of desire, such negative instances need
hardly be taken into account in a survey of universal
human impulses. The longing for unconsciousness is
moreover so passive a condition of mind, that by itself
it could never explain expressional activities of the
more violent or elaborate sort. And it is even more
insufficient as an explanation of all those secondary
expressions which are to occupy us in the sequel. Art
production would never have reached so high a development
if it had served only as a sedative for human
feelings. But neither does art, any more than the
direct activities of expression, involve mere excitement;
it too fulfils, and with even greater efficacy, a relieving
and cathartic mission. While supplying man with a
means of intensifying the feelings connected with all the
varied activities of the soul, art at the same time bestows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
upon him that inward calm in which all strong emotions
find their relief.</p>

<p>Every interpretation of art which does not pay due
attention to both of these aspects must needs be one-sided
and incomplete.</p>

<small>SOCIAL EXPRESSION</small></h2></div>


<p>In order to find an explanation of the nature and origin
of the art-impulse we were compelled to enter upon a
digression on the general psychology of feeling. It
appeared from this hasty examination that in the motor
concomitants of physical as well as of mental feeling
we have to do with a form of activity which, taken by
itself, is independent of all external motives. It was
shown that the diffusion of a feeling-tone always corresponds
to some active manifestation, generally outward,
which increases in the same degree as the state of consciousness
gains in intensity and distinctness. Besides
these immediate transformations of energy which, owing
to the law of inertia, follow the primary enhancement
or inhibition of function, we met with reactions of a
more conscious kind, by which the organism strives to
overcome the inhibition of pain, and to keep up the
excitement of pleasure. And it was also found that the
universal animal desire to increase every pleasure and
to relieve every pain has given rise to a multitude of
secondary manifestations, by which we try to sustain
every pleasure, to make it more distinct for consciousness,
and thus enhance it by expression, while, during
states of pain, we strive for relief in diversion or in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
violent motor discharge. Finally it was remarked that
by the side of this expressional impulse we must take
account of a yearning after increased consciousness,
which leads us to pursue, even at the risk of some
passing pain, all feelings and emotions by which our
sensation of life is reinforced and intensified. All these
impulses, accompanied by higher or lower degrees of
conscious endeavour, are psychical phenomena of fundamental
importance. They are not restricted to any
particular stage of culture. And their coercive force is
equal—nay, even superior to that of the imitative impulse,
the play-impulse, and the impulse “to attract by
pleasing.” If we could deduce the desire for artistic
creation from the activities connected with feeling, we
should here find the explanation of its universality as
well as of its force.</p>

<p>But among the manifestations described in the foregoing
chapters there is none which directly leads us to
the artistic activity. As against the <i lang="de">Spieltrieb</i> theories
it was objected that play never develops of itself into
art, so it may now be objected, with as much reason,
that all immediate or secondary emotional manifestations,
however interesting they may be, give us no
information on artistic manifestations. The instinctive
tendency to express overmastering feeling, to enhance
pleasure, and to seek relief from pain, forms the most
deep-seated motive of all human activity. We can
therefore derive the distinctive qualities of artistic
production from this impulse only when it has been
proved that art is better able than any other kind of
mental function to serve and satisfy the requirements
which arise from this impulse when it occurs in its
purest form.</p>

<p>That this is the case, is the fundamental hypothesis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
upon which this work is based. It was impossible to prove
its validity as long as emotional manifestations were
treated as phenomena in the psychical life of the individual.
For art is in its innermost nature a social
activity. In order to elucidate the connection between
art-impulse and emotional activities, we must therefore
examine the latter as they appear in the social relations
of mankind. We do not believe that any new principles
are necessary for this purpose. We need only apply to
social phenomena the same laws which were found to
be valid for the emotional life of the individual. As,
however, the legitimacy of such a course may be questioned,
we must first devote some pages to a treatment
of what we may call—if the expression is allowed—the
interindividual life.</p>

<p>This digression brings us into a field of inquiry—that
of the psychical conditions of social life—which
during recent years has been the object of certain most
important scientific researches. The investigations into
the psychology of masses, as well as the experiments on
suggestive therapeutics, have proved to how great an
extent mental states may be transmitted from individual
to individual by unconscious imitation of the accompanying
movements. The doctrine of universal sympathy,
a clear statement of which was given long ago in the
ethical theory of Adam Smith,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> has thus acquired a
psychological justification in the modern theories of
imitative movement. Contemporary science has at last
learned to appreciate the fundamental importance of
imitation for the development of human culture.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> And
some authors have even gone so far as to endeavour to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
deduce all sociological laws from this one principle. At
the same time natural history has begun to pay more
and more attention to the indispensability of imitation for
the full development of instincts, as well as for training
in those activities which are the most necessary in life.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>It is fortunate for the theory of art that the importance
of the imitative functions has thus been simultaneously
acknowledged in various departments of science.
Whatever one may think of the somewhat audacious
generalisations which have been made in the recent
application of this new principle, it is incontestable that
the æsthetic activities can be understood and explained
only by reference to universal tendency to imitate. It
is also significant that writers on æsthetic had felt
themselves compelled to set up a theory of imitation
long before experimental psychologists had begun to
turn their attention in this direction. In Germany the
enjoyment of form and form-relations has since Vischer’s
time been interpreted as the result of the movements by
which not only our eye, but also our whole body, follows
the outlines of external things.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In France Jouffroy
stated the condition for the receiving of æsthetic impressions
to be a “power of internally imitating the states
which are externally manifested in living nature.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> In
England, finally, Vernon Lee and Anstruther Thompson
have founded a theory of beauty and ugliness upon this
same psychical impulse to copy in our own unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
movements the forms of objects.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> And in the writings
of, for instance, Home,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Hogarth,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Dugald Stewart,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and
Spencer,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> there can be found a multitude of isolated
remarks on the influence which is in a direct way exercised
on our mental life by the perception of lines and forms.</p>

<p>In most of these theories and observations, however,
the imitative activity has been noticed only in so far
as it contributes to the æsthetic delight which may be
derived from sensual impressions. But its importance
is by no means so restricted as this; on the contrary,
we believe it to be a fundamental condition for the
existence of intuition itself. Without all these imperceptible
tracing movements with which our body
accompanies the adaptation of the eye-muscles to the
outlines of external objects, our notions of depth, height,
and distance, and so on, would certainly be far less distinct
than they are.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> On the other hand, the habit of executing
such movements has, so to say, brought the external
world within the sphere of the internal. The world has
been measured with man as a standard, and objects have
been translated into the language of mental experience.
The impressions have hereby gained not only in emotional
tone, but also in intellectual comprehensibility.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Greater still is the importance of imitation for our
intuition of moving objects. And a difficult movement
itself is fully understood only when it has been imitated,
either internally or in actual outward activity. The
idea of a movement, therefore, is generally associated
with an arrested impulse to perform it.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Closer introspection
will show every one to how great a part our
knowledge, even of persons, is built up of motor
elements. By unconsciously and imperceptibly copying
in our own body the external behaviour of a man, we
may learn to understand him with benevolent or malevolent
sympathy.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> And it will no doubt be admitted
by most readers that the reason why they know their
friends and foes better than they know any one else is
that they carry the remembrance of them not only in
their eyes, but in their whole body. When in idle
moments we find the memory of an absent friend surging
up in our mind with no apparent reason, we may often
note, to our astonishment, that we have just been
unconsciously adopting one of his characteristic attitudes,
or imitating his peculiar gestures or gait.</p>

<p>It may, however, be objected that the above-mentioned
instances refer only to a particular class of
individuals. In other minds, it will be said, the world-picture
is entirely built up of visual and acoustic
elements. It is also impossible to deny that the classification
of minds in different types, which modern
psychology has introduced, is as legitimate as it is
advantageous for the purposes of research. But we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
hardly believe that such divisions have in view anything
more than a relative predominance of the several
psychical elements.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> It is easily understood that a man
in whose store of memory visual or acoustic images
occupy the foremost place may be inclined to deny that
motor sensations of unconscious copying enter to any
extent into his psychical experience. But an exclusively
visual world-image, if such a thing is possible, must
evidently be not only emotionally poorer, but also
intellectually less distinct and less complete, than an
intuition, in which such motor elements are included.</p>

<p>The importance of motor sensations in the psychology
of knowledge is by itself of no æsthetic interest. The
question has been touched upon in this connection only
because of the illustration which it gives to the imitation
theory. If, as we believe is the case, it is really necessary,
for the purpose of acquiring a complete comprehension
of things and events, to “experience” them—that
is to say, to pursue and seize upon them, not only with
the particular organ of sense to which they appeal, but
also by tracing movements of the whole body, then
there is no need to wonder at the universality of the
imitative impulse. Imitation does not only, according
to this view, facilitate our training in useful activities,
and aid us in deriving an æsthetic delight from our
sensations: it serves also, and perhaps primarily, as an
expedient for the accommodating of ourselves to the
external world, and for the explaining of things by
reference to ourselves. It is therefore natural that
imitative movements should occupy so great a place
among the activities of children and primitive men.
And we can also understand why this fundamental
impulse, which has played so important a part in racial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
as well as in individual education, may become so great
as to be a disease and dominate the whole of conscious
life.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> As children we all imitated before we comprehended,
and we have learned to comprehend by imitating.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
It is only when we have grown familiar by
imitation with the most important data of perception
that we become capable of appropriating knowledge in
a more rational way. Although no adult has any need to
resort to external imitation in order to comprehend new
impressions, it is still only natural that in a pathological
condition he should relapse into the primitive imitative
reaction. And it is equally natural that an internal,
<i>i.e.</i> arrested, imitation should take place in all our
perceptions. After this explanation of the universality
of this phenomenon we have no further need to occupy
ourselves with the general psychology of imitation. We
have here only to take notice of its importance for the
communication of feeling.</p>

<p>As is well known, it is only in cases of abnormally
increased sensibility—for instance, in some of the stages
of hypnotism and thought transmission—that the motor
counterpart of a mental state can be imitated with such
faithfulness and completeness that the imitator is thereby
enabled to partake of all the <i>intellectual</i> elements of the
state existing in another. The hedonic qualities, on
the other hand, which are physiologically conditioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
by much simpler motor counterparts, may of course be
transmitted with far greater perfection: it is easier to
suggest a pleasure than a thought. It is also evident
that it is the most general hedonic and volitional
elements which have been considered by the German
authors on æsthetic in their theories on internal imitation
(“Die innere Nachahmung”). They seem to have
thought that the adoption of the attitudes and the
performance of the movements which usually accompany
a given emotional state will also succeed to some extent
in producing a similar emotional state. This assumption
is perfectly legitimate, even if the connection between
feeling and movement be interpreted in the associative
way. And it needs no justification when the motor
changes are considered as the physiological correlate of
the feeling itself.</p>

<p>Everyday experience affords many examples of the
way in which feelings are called into existence by the
imitation of their expressive movements. A child repeats
the smiles and the laughter of its parents, and can
thus partake of their joy long before it is able to understand
its cause.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Adult life naturally does not give us
many opportunities of observing this pure form of
direct and almost automatic transmission. But even
in adult life we may often meet with an exchange of
feeling which seems almost independent of any intellectual
communication. Lovers know it, and intimate
friends like the brothers Goncourt,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> to say nothing of
people who stand in so close a rapport with each other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
as a hypnotiser and his subject.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> And even where there
is no previous sympathetic relation, a state of joy or
sadness may often, if it is only distinctly expressed,
pass over, so to say, from the individual who has been
under the influence of its objective cause, to another
who, as it were, borrows the feeling, but remains unconscious
of its cause. We experience this phenomenon
almost daily in the influence exerted upon us by social
intercourse, and even by those aspects of nature—for
instance, blue open sky or overhanging mountains—which
naturally call up in us the physical manifestation
of emotional states. The coercive force with which our
surroundings—animate or inanimate—compel us to
adopt the feelings which are suggested by their attitudes,
forms, or movements, is perhaps as a rule too
weak to be noticed by a self-controlled, unemotional
man. But if we want an example of this influence at
its strongest, we need but remember how difficult it is
for an individual to resist the contagion of collective
feeling.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> On public occasions the common mood,
whether of joy or sorrow, is often communicated even
to those who were originally possessed by the opposite
feeling. So powerful is the infection of great excitement
that—according to M. Féré—even a perfectly
sober man who takes part in a drinking bout may often
be tempted to join in the antics of his drunken comrades
in a sort of second-hand intoxication, “drunkenness by
induction.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> In the great mental epidemics of the
Middle Ages this kind of contagion operated with more
fatal results than ever before or afterwards. But even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
in modern times a popular street riot may often show us
something of the same phenomenon. The great tumult
in London in 1886 afforded, it is said, a good opportunity
of observing how people who had originally maintained
an indifferent attitude were gradually carried away by
the general excitement, even to the extent of joining in
the outrages.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In this instance the contagious effect of
expressional movements was undoubtedly facilitated by
their connection with so primary an impulse as that of
rapine and destruction. But the case is the same with
all the activities which appear as the outward manifestations
of our strongest feeling-states. They all consist of
instinctive actions with which every one is well familiar
from his own experience. It is therefore natural that
anger, hate, or love may be communicated almost
automatically from an individual to masses, and from
masses to individuals.</p>

<p>Now that the principle of the interindividual
diffusion of feeling has been stated and explained, we
may return to our main line of research and examine
its bearings on the expressional impulse. We have
seen that in the social surroundings of the individual
there is enacted a process resembling that which takes
place within his own organism. Just as functional
modifications spread from organ to organ, just as wider
and wider zones of the system are brought into participation
in the primary enhancement or inhibition, so a
feeling is diffused from an individual to a circle of
sympathisers who repeat its expressional movements.
And just as all the widened “somatic resonances”
contribute to the primary feeling-tone increased strength
and increased definiteness, so must the emotional state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
of an individual be enhanced by retroactive stimulation
from the expressions by which the state has, so to say,
been continued in others. By the reciprocal action of
primary movements and borrowed movements, which
mutually imitate each other, the social expression
operates in the same way as the individual expression.
And we are entitled to consider it as a secondary result
of the general expressional impulse, that when mastered
by an overpowering feeling we seek enhancement or
relief by retroaction from sympathisers, who reproduce
and in their expression represent the mental state by
which we are dominated.</p>

<p>In point of fact we can observe in the manifestations
of all strong feelings which have not found a
satisfactory relief in individual expression, a pursuit of
social resonance. A happy man wants to see glad
faces around him, in order that from their expression
he may derive further nourishment and increase for
his own feeling. Hence the benevolent attitude of
mind which as a rule accompanies all strong and pure
joy. Hence also the widespread tendency to express
joy by gifts or hospitality. In moods of depression we
similarly desire a response to our feeling from our
surroundings. In the depth of despair we may long
for a universal cataclysm to extend, as it were, our
own pain. As joy naturally makes men good, so pain
often makes them hard and cruel. That this is not
always the case is a result of the increased power of
sympathy which we gain by every experienced pain.
Moreover, we have need of sympathetic rapport for our
motor reactions against pain. All the active manifestations
of sorrow, despair, or anger which are not wholly
painful in themselves are facilitated by the reciprocal
influence of collective excitement. Thus all strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
feelings, whether pleasurable or painful, act as socialising
factors.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> This socialising action may be observed at all
stages of development. Even the animals seek their
fellows in order to stimulate themselves and each other
by the common expression of an overpowering feeling.
As has been remarked by Espinas, the flocking together
of the male birds during the pairing season is perhaps
as much due to this craving for mutual stimulation as
to the desire to compete for the favour of the hen.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
The howling choirs of the macaws<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and the drum
concerts of the chimpanzees<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> are still better and unmistakable
instances of collective emotional expression.
In man we find the results of the same craving for
social expression in the gatherings for rejoicing or
mourning which are to be met with in all tribes, of all
degrees of development. And as a still higher development
of the same fundamental impulse, there appears
in man the artistic activity.</p>

<p>The more conscious our craving for retroaction from
sympathisers, the more there must also be developed in
us a conscious endeavour to cause the feeling to be
appropriated by as many as possible and as completely
as possible. The expressional impulse is not satisfied
by the resonance which an occasional public, however
sympathetic, is able to afford. Its natural aim is
to bring more and more sentient beings under the
influence of the same emotional state. It seeks to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
vanquish the refractory and arouse the indifferent. An
echo, a true and powerful echo—that is what it desires
with all the energy of an unsatisfied longing. As a
result of this craving the expressional activities lead to
artistic production. The work of art presents itself
as the most effective means by which the individual
is enabled to convey to wider and wider circles of
sympathisers an emotional state similar to that by
which he is himself dominated.</p>

<p>We propose in the next chapter to indicate the way
in which art in its various forms has served the expressional
craving.</p>

<small>DEDUCTION OF ART-FORMS</small></h2></div>


<p>In the science of art many hypotheses have been
advanced as to the order in which the different art-forms
have made their appearance. We do not intend
to bring forward any new arguments on this much-debated
question. Even if our knowledge of prehistoric
man were so complete and trustworthy as to
entitle us to draw any conclusions as to the earliest
stages in art-development, such an appeal to history
would in the present connection constitute a grave confusion
of standpoints. As long as we are occupied with
that abstract datum, the purely artistic activity, we cannot
possibly find any support for our reasoning in
existing works of art, concerning which the question
may always be raised whether the motive was or was
not a purely autotelic art-impulse. We shall therefore
in the following pages entirely ignore the question of
historical sequence and restrict our attention to the
various degrees of theoretical priority. Starting from
the interpretation of artistic activity which was postulated,
but not yet proved, in the preceding chapter, we
shall consider those art-forms as most primordial which
stand in the closest connection with the expression of
feeling. By comparing those manifestations of art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>-activity
which are from our standpoint elementary, with
the non-æsthetic expression of emotional states, we shall
try to isolate the peculiarly artistic qualities in their
simplest possible form. If the result of such a treatment
prove consistent with general æsthetic ideals, as
exhibited in the literature of art, this fact will naturally
go to the credit of our explanation.</p>

<p>The purest and most typical expression of simple
feeling is that which consists of mere random movements.
Those activities, whether of the whole body or
of special parts,—the larynx, for instance,—which follow
immediately upon, or rather accompany, a state of
pleasure or pain, are in themselves entirely non-æsthetic.
Thus it is impossible to see anything artistic in the
spectacle of a man leaping or shouting for joy. Yet the
lowest kind of lyrical music and lyrical “gymnastic”
dance may be almost as directly connected with the
original state of feeling as these purely expressional
activities. The only difference is that in music and
dance the movements have been limited and restrained
by the adoption of a fixed sequence in time. This fixed
sequence in time—the rhythm—must therefore, from
our point of view, be considered as the simplest of all
art-forms.</p>

<p>If we were to give a complete account of the
psychology of rhythm, it would be impossible not to
resort to a sociological and historical mode of treatment.
By Dr. Wallaschek’s researches on primitive music it
has been conclusively shown how important a part
rhythm, as a means of facilitating co-operation, has
played in the struggle for existence.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> And this utili<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>tarian
explanation has recently been carried even farther
by Professor Bücher, who points out the invaluable
saving of effort which the individual obtains by regulating
his movements in a fixed sequence of time.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> We
may think that Professor Bücher has stretched his point
too far in endeavouring to derive almost all music and
poetry from the economical exigencies of labour;<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> but
there can be no doubt that in whichever way the
ultimate origin of musical arts be explained, their
development is largely due to the practical advantages
of rhythm. These considerations, however, which will
be developed in the following chapters, need not detain
us here, where we have to do with the presumably non-utilitarian
and purely æsthetic work of art. If the
practical advantages of economy and co-operation can
be eliminated,—if we can imagine a dance and a song
which has not for its aim the facilitation or regulation
of some form of work or the stimulation of some effort,
which, in short, has its sole aim and purpose in itself,—then
the art-element in this dance or song must be explicable
without reference to “foreign” purposes.</p>

<p>The only explanation we have been able to find is
one which brings us back to the standpoint of the last
chapter. Looking upon art as an essentially social
activity, we naturally bestow our main attention upon
rhythm as a factor of unification. But as we are not
allowed to take into account its importance for <i>practical</i>
co-operation, we can only interpret it as a means of
bringing about <i>emotional</i> community. And it is evident
that the fixed sequence in time, when used for the
purpose of communicating a state of feeling, must pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>duce
the same effect as when it serves the purpose of
diffusing and regulating the impulses to work.</p>

<p>This fact can also be observed in all cases of social
expression. The most general and simple states of
emotional excitement, such as a festive mood or a warlike
intoxication, may indeed be diffused with sufficient
efficacy by simple contagious imitation. But even with
regard to such eminently infectious feelings, if a great
mass of men is to be collectively and simultaneously
stimulated by a common execution of the appropriate
expressive movements, these movements must be regulated
by the adoption of a rhythm. On the other
hand, as soon as the expression is fixed in rhythmical
form its contagious power is incalculably increased.
By its incessant and regular recurrence, the rhythm
takes a ruthless hold of the attention, and thereby compels
even the most recalcitrant to yield to the power of
the transmitted feeling.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>As evidence of the irresistibility with which a
rhythmical expression may rouse an audience to an
almost unvoluntary imitation, one may refer to the
familiar effects of the southern dances. The tarantella,
as is well known, often entices the unwilling as well as
the willing to join in its wild movements. And the
same is said of several other Spanish and Italian dances.
We need only refer to the apologue of the Fandango, so
often used as a motive of ballets, in which the dance,
brought into court for causing disturbance, compels judge
and jury to yield to its temptations and dissolve the
sitting for a fierce gambade.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Such stories give an
exaggerated yet typical example of the great influence
which the sight of dancing exercises on the lively Latin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
nations. An impassive Northerner can indeed always
master the impulse to join actively in a wild dance.
But even he cannot avoid sharing the excitement by
internal imitation.</p>

<p>It is, however, impossible to decide with any exactitude
whether the effects which a dance-performance
exercises on the spectators are mainly due to the movements
themselves or to the rhythm by which they are
regulated. In order, therefore, to estimate at its proper
value the importance of time, it is necessary to examine
it as it appears when isolated from bodily movement.
The lowest types of music, in which the element of
melody is of no importance, show us rhythm in its
simplest and purest form. Such instruments as drums,
tom-toms, and castanets may serve as a most effective
means of emotional excitation. The same exaltation or
depression, which in a dance is conveyed by a series of
varied expressive movements, may be transmitted with
almost equal effectiveness by a simple sequence of
sounds. Any group of acoustic impressions following
each other in a fixed rhythm may, independently of their
character, arouse in the listener the same modifications
of functions and activities, and hence also the same
emotional state, as was originally expressed by this
particular time-sequence. Thus pure feeling, as it
appears when abstraction has been made of all intellectual
elements, can be as it were exteriorised in rhythmical
form. And, which is of still greater importance,
a pure feeling can in this exteriorisation be fixed down
for future repetition. Even in its simplest manifestations
art is thus capable of raising an emotional state
beyond the limitations of space and time.</p>

<p>It is most natural, when speaking of the connection
between feeling and rhythm, to refer to dance and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
simplest vocal and instrumental music. But it goes
without saying that the effects are the same in kind,
although less in degree, when the time-sequence is
impressed upon our mind in some more indirect way.
Thus, by appropriating the element of rhythm, which
enters into all poetry, we may in reciting or reading a
verse partake of an emotional state in the same way as
we do when joining, actively or “internally,” the movements
of a dance. Similarly, the formative and decorative
arts may, by compelling our eye to follow a
regular arrangement of lines and figures, transmit to
us an emotional excitement by the mediation of rhythm.
Ornament, that purely popular art, may therefore be
compared as to its psychological effects with simple
popular dances and melodies.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>In these three logically most primordial arts, viz.
gymnastic dance, geometric ornament, and unmelodic,
simply rhythmical music or singing, the unmotived
“objectless” feeling is expressed in a medium which
directly conveys to us its accompanying modifications
of activity. Notwithstanding the meagreness of their intellectual
content, these purely lyrical forms, if we may
so call them, are therefore emotionally suggestive to a
high degree. General and indistinct moods, such as a
feeling of ease, of liberation from restraint, of assurance
and power, etc., may by them be transmitted with
unsurpassable fidelity. But their expressive power is
also confined to such purely hedonic states. Whenever,
therefore, the feeling forms a part of a differentiated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
and fully formed emotion, the impulse to social expression
must avail itself of some more adequate means of
transmission.</p>

<p>In point of fact there will nearly always, even in
the most impulsive outburst of pleasure or pain, enter
an element of simple dramatic representation, by which
some of the mental qualities distinctive of the various
emotions are communicated. With regard to dancing,
for instance, we can only speak in the abstract of any
simply “gymnastic” forms.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Even if the movements
originally aim at nothing but enhancement or relief for
an indistinct emotional state, they will unavoidably
take the character of such movements as have been
connected with some emotion, and thereby, in spectators
as well as in performers, awaken some faint revival of
this complex state of feeling. This process can be very
clearly observed in the case of the pseudo-pantomimes
which are so general among lower tribes. When a
savage is in a high-strung state of feeling, he generally
resorts to the same movements which have served him
to express the greatest and most frequent excitements
of his life. Among warlike tribes the dances of joy,
as well as their developments, salutation dances, and
complimentary dances,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> generally have a distinct military
character.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> No doubt it may be contended that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
particular character of these pantomimes was originally
a result of political considerations. In a military state
of society it is perhaps simply a measure of safety to
receive strangers with threats. But however important
this utilitarian aspect may be, it seems more probable
that a great part of these apparently unmotived pantomimes,
which are executed when we should expect
only a simple outburst of joy, are best interpreted as
real instances of borrowed expression, necessitated by
the limitations of our means of expression and furthered
by associative processes.</p>

<p>In the life of self-contained educated men we do
not generally meet with this phenomenon in so distinct
a form. But even here the fragmentary pantomimes
into which a man often falls when mastered by a quite
indistinct feeling—we need only refer to the erotic character
of embraces and other gestures of joy—show us
that expression always adds an element of definiteness
to the psychical state expressed. When treating of the
reactions consequent upon bodily pain, we have already
had to take into account the species of imaginative
materialisation, as though pain were a concrete thing,
a shirt of Nessus, by which a sufferer is generally
induced to explain his automatic movements. Here
we need only point out that a similar, so to speak,
mythogenic influence, a natural tendency to personification,
results not only from reactions to pain,
but also from all expressive activities. An indistinct
mood of pleasure thus generally passes over into a joy—that
is, a feeling which is referred to some cause,
imaginary or real—when the functional enhancement
has reached our voluntary muscles. An oppression,
which in its origin may be purely physiological, is
transformed, when the bodily modifications become more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
differentiated,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> into fear of something unknown—for
instance, some impending danger.</p>

<p>Since it is so difficult for the individual himself to
perceive a mental state as one of pure sensation with
no element of thought, we need not wonder that his
expression always transmits to the spectator something
more than the mere excitement or depression of simple
feeling. However strictly we try to isolate the pure
rhythm of a lyrical performance, there will always slip
into it an element of mimetic expression—we do not
know of a better adjective—which suggests a mental
state, distincter and better defined than that of pure
feeling. In reality, therefore, the dramatic forms of
dancing are no less primordial than those purely
rhythmical manifestations which the necessities of
treatment have compelled us to consider as a separate
group.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> It is also evident that the dramatic or mimetic
element will increase in importance as the endeavour
to represent mental states and transmit them to outsiders
becomes more conscious and deliberate.</p>

<p>We have dealt at sufficient length with the trans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>mission
of emotion by mimetic expression. A striking
instance of this process has already been found outside
the domain of art in the contagiousness of collective
states of mind. When art adopts emotional transmission
as an end in itself, this contagiousness is naturally
increased. On the side of the executant we have to
suppose a conscious endeavour to make the mimic
expression as easily appropriated as possible; on the
side of the spectator an increased readiness to partake
of the expressed feeling. A theatrical audience, indeed,
unlike a riotous mob, does not generally go so far as
to imitate its leader, the actor, by actual movement.
Conscious of the fictitious character of the performance,
the spectators are able to resist the sub-conscious volitional
impulses which they receive. But while thus
controlling their outward activity, those who attentively
follow the acting may nevertheless appropriate in an
almost direct manner the feelings represented. Although
they remain passive spectators and preserve an appearance
of immobility, they are apt to follow, in a kind
of abridgment, the attitudes and facial play of the
performers. At the most critical stages of a popular
melodrama the audience always falls into an unconscious
pantomime, which, as Engel remarked, to the
psychological observer is of far greater interest than
that enacted on the stage.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In the higher forms of
dramatic art this direct transmission of feeling no doubt
loses a great deal of its importance. But we believe
that every attentive playgoer has occasional opportunities
of observing, in himself if not in his neighbours,
faint traces of an unconscious and involuntary imitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
which follows all the movements of the performers.
Such imitation will, of course, become more and more
pronounced the more the dialogue gives place to pantomimic
action, and the more vividly and convincingly
this action is represented. As an example of the power
with which a good mimic may compel even the most
critical spectator to participate in emotional moods, we
cannot quote anything better than the description of
Garrick in Lichtenberg’s <cite>Briefe aus England</cite>. “His
facial expression is so powerful as to invite imitation.
When he is grave his audience is grave. When he
frowns the house frowns, and it smiles when he smiles.
In his hidden pleasure, and in his intimate manner,
when, in an aside, he gives the audience his confidence,
there is something so winning that one’s whole soul
goes out to this fascinating man.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>It may be thought that the above described processes
occur only in those arts which can be called
dramatic in the proper sense of the word. If this were
the case, the principle of emotional transmission by
direct imitation would of course be of very restricted
æsthetic importance. We think, however, that a histrionic
element can be noticed, with greater or less
distinctness, no doubt, in all the various forms of
artistic production. It certainly enters into literature,
where popular authors, especially of the sentimental
class, always possessed the secret of suggesting feelings
by representing their manifestations in “contagious”
description. And it plays an important part in all
the arts of design, formative as well as decorative.</p>

<p>We may often catch ourselves faintly imitating
movements or attitudes represented in sculpture. And
this influence of suggestion is felt not only, as Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
Lange thinks, in the case of melodramatic sculpture—expressive
of the most violent passions—it contributes
also, in no slight degree, to our enjoyment of the forms
which represent the gentler moods.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> However calm
and impassive the facial expression of a statue may be,
the attitude of the body will always communicate to us
a feeling of some kind, of strength and assurance, or
perhaps of settled melancholy.</p>

<p>In the art of painting this mimetic principle tends
to be lost among the descriptive elements. The direct
transmission of feeling is replaced by an indirect and
associative one. Still, there are few works, if any, in
which the histrionic factor is entirely lacking. It may
be detected with especial clearness in sentimental or
comic figure-painting, which often literally infects us
with the emotions it represents. When looking at a
Japanese caricature, for instance, of the gods of happiness,
we often laugh with the laughter of the picture
long before we have realised the cause of it, or formulated
any judgment as to the artistic merits of the
representation.</p>

<p>It is true that pictorial art has many branches in
which the human figure does not appear at all. But
this absence does not by any means entail a complete
loss of mimetic suggestiveness. As our perceptions,
whether of animate or inanimate objects, are always
accompanied by a complete or abortive imitation, any
kind of form or movement may call forth in us activities
distinctive of some emotional mood. Just as a rhythmic
series of simple acoustic or visual impressions may
occasion in us the functional modifications accompany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>ing
simple feeling, and thereby arouse in us the mental
state of which this rhythm is an exteriorisation, so the
mimic movements which are the physiological counterparts
of distinct emotion may be, so to speak, translated
into lines and forms, by which the emotion is reproduced
in other minds. Thus even an object of handicraft—a
vase, for instance—may, by the suggestiveness of its shape,
affect our emotional life in an almost immediate way.
And geometric ornament has an equal, if not even greater,
power of conjuring up in us emotional states, which we
read into the angles and volutes. Finally, the concrete
objects of nature are full of “expressive qualities”
which make them available as a means of conveying our
feelings. The whole world of visual reality can thus be
used in a kind of indirect mimetism,—a dramatic expression,
so to speak, in which natural and abstract
forms replace the human body.</p>

<p>The course of our argument has led us to emphasise
the lyrical and dramatic elements in artistic activity.
But we do not by any means wish to underrate the fact
that it is only a very small minority of works the nature
of which can be exhaustively described by these two
qualities. With increased importance of the intellectual
elements accompanying the emotional states, direct
emotional suggestion must unavoidably appear an inadequate
means of communication. A joy or a sorrow,
together with a notion of some objective cause of it,
rapture or admiration, anger, hate, or despair,—all these
and similar states can be completely conveyed to an
outsider only in so far as they have been accounted for
to his intellect. As the theoretically latest manifestation
of the craving for social expression there will thus
appear an impulse to represent or describe objective
events or things, by which a feeling similar to that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
the producing artist may be called forth in his audience.
And thus in almost all art-forms, in ornament and
music as well as in painting and novels, there will be
found an imitation of nature which serves what in the
widest use of the term we may call an epic purpose.</p>

<p>The intellectual justification of a feeling by representation
of a cause and the orderly form of its direct
or secondary expression are, however, in themselves insufficient
to secure a response; the attention and goodwill
of the audience must first be conciliated. A
sympathetic rapport always presupposes a state of compliance
in at least one of the parties involved. When
seeking by means of a work of art to obtain a response
to an overmastering feeling the artist is thus constrained
to exercise persuasion upon his real or fictitious public.
As M. Sully-Prudhomme has finely remarked, it is only
by first caressing our senses that art rouses our feelings and
awakens our thoughts.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Besides that element of beauty
which can be immediately derived from the expressed
content, and that element of gracefulness which follows
as result of the psychical freedom attained by expression,
there are in nearly all works of art qualities whose aim
is exclusively to please. If we may risk a somewhat
audacious parallel, we may say that the work of art, in
the same way as a living organism, an animal or a plant,
entices the attention and charms the senses with the
beauty of its “means of attraction,” not for the sake of
these attractions themselves, but for the secret they
at the same time conceal and disclose. All these allurements
might easily cause a superficial observer to lose
sight of the simple fact which lies at the bottom of the
artistic work, viz. the feeling-state which demands expression
and response. We thus see why the impulse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
to attract by pleasing has been considered as synonymous
with the art-impulse.</p>

<p>As has already been remarked, such an interpretation
cannot account for the coercive force of the artistic impulse.
And equally with the theories based upon the
epic or descriptive elements in art, it is incompatible with
the principle of the unity of art. If the logical evolution
of the art-forms is conceived in the way we have
described, all the various manifestations of artistic
activity can be derived from one common principle.
And by the aid of this one principle we are able to explain
the force of that impulse which, with similar coercive
force, urges to creation within the various art-forms.</p>

<p>However much the artistic impulse may become
differentiated with the progress of culture, its innermost
nature will always remain the same. However complex
its manifestations, their aim is always to secure a faithful
response to an overmastering feeling. The more
accomplished the work of art, the more its creator will
become independent of the chance audience, which by
its sympathetic expression produces an enhancing retroaction
on his feeling. He learns to give his mental
states an embodiment which facilitates their reproduction
in wider surroundings. Thus the expressional impulse
directs him to place himself in sympathetic rapport with
a fictitious public. He creates, that is to say, expresses
himself, for an ideal spectator,—for posterity or for himself.
With a proud indifference to his most immediate
social environment, he may thus consider his own production
as perfectly exempt of any social motivation.
The aphorism of Mill, “All poetry is a soliloquy,” would
no doubt be accepted by many of the most eminent
poets. But the psychological observer cannot help remarking
that in such soliloquies the ego serves as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
substitute for an external public. The artist has in a
sense a double capacity; and artistic creation in solitude
may be always explained by the fact that the creator
exists also as his own spectator.</p>

<p>The production of even the most individualistic and
most isolated artists can therefore be explained only by
sociological considerations. And the same is the case
with those artists who work only for posterity. It would
be wrong to say that art in any one of its higher manifestations
aims at transmitting a feeling. Its purpose
is far rather an immortalisation. But this very desire
to perpetuate a mental state, this desire which constrains
the artist to strive indefatigably for the attainment of a
form, capable of imparting to all men of every country
and every age the same enhancement and the same
rapture which he has himself experienced—this highest
manifestation of the expressional impulse—can be fully
explained only by reference to the enhancing and relieving
power of social expression. In whatever light
the art-impulse may appear to the reflecting consciousness
of the producing artist, this is the only consistent
interpretation at which we can arrive by an examination
of the artistic activity on psychological grounds.</p>

<small>ART THE RELIEVER</small></h2></div>


<p>In the endeavour to secure the transmission and perpetuation
of a feeling, the expressional activity gradually
loses its purely impulsive character. From an almost
reflex outlet for abnormal nervous pressure, it is more
and more transformed into deliberate artistic production,
which is conscious of its aim as well as of the means for
attaining it. The elaboration of a work of art, in which
the expression of a feeling-state is to be concentrated,
and concentrated in a way which not only facilitates
but even enforces in the spectator the assimilation of
this state, is a complicated operation which cannot
of course take place without the effectual co-operation of
intellectual and volitional activities. And their co-operation,
on the other hand, must evidently exercise
some influence on the primordial feeling.</p>

<p>It is a familiar observation, duly emphasised in
all psychological handbooks, that strong feelings make
clear thought impossible. Everyday experience, as well
as scientific experiment, gives unmistakable evidence
of the influence which abnormal excitement or depression
exercises, not only on our ideas and their associations,
but even on the perceptions. The converse has perhaps
not been stated so often. Still, it does not admit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
doubt that intensified intellectual activity may, in some
cases, even more effectually than motor reaction, overcome
the tyranny of a hypernormal feeling. It is true
that every mental state becomes more distinct as a
phenomenon of consciousness when our thoughts are
directed towards it. Feelings of low and moderate
intensity may even be enhanced in their purely emotional
aspect if we let our intellect play on them. But as soon
as a greater intensity of feeling is reached, this relation
is reversed. Joy which is so great as to be a burden,
“Die Noth der Fülle,”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and numbing despair, must
inevitably decrease when there is an increase of distinctness
in their intellectual elements. The more we can
compel ourselves to contemplate with cool and clear
attention the causes and manifestations of such high-strung
states, the more we are also able to master them.
It is a familiar experience to everyone that strong fear
can be vanquished, if only we can succeed in diverting
all our attention to its objective source, and “stare the
danger in the face.” When the attention is concentrated
and intensified to the utmost degree, it may even, as in
the case of fascination, entirely prevent, to our own
danger, the very rise of this self-preserving emotion.</p>

<p>In artistic creation we are not concerned with an
intentional or unintentional effort to overcome feeling.
On the contrary the aim is here to keep the strongest
possible hold of it in order to give it the most effective
embodiment. So irreconcilable, however, is the conflict
between emotional excitement and intellectual activity,
that the latter, even when it expressly serves the purposes
of emotional enhancement, must neutralise the
excess of feeling. A state of strong pleasure or pain
can never be rendered intelligible to outsiders, unless its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
expression is bridled and disciplined by thought. By
being thus embodied in a fixed form the feeling gains
in conceivability as well as in infectious power. But
while the effect on spectators and listeners is in this
way increased, the artistic form influences the feeling
subject himself in a quite different way. Its very clearness
and distinctness necessarily brings something of
that calm which all excitement seeks as relief.</p>

<p>The immediate reaction which the work of art
exercises on its own creator is of course most easily
seen and understood in the “higher” art-forms with
their pronounced intellectual elements. Literary instances
of the “poetic cure” for harassing or oppressing
emotion are too numerous to be mentioned. The only
point we need dwell on is the question how these
instances are to be interpreted. When a poet seeks to
give shape and form to his own sufferings by means of
fiction, the relief he obtains is no doubt in part an effect
of the diversion of activity into the channels of expression.
But to a still greater degree it may be a result of
the healthful influence exercised by the contemplation
of objective reality in the finished work of art. Such
an influence is unmistakable in the most illustrious
instance of artistic production as a life-preserving
expedient: Goethe’s <cite>Leiden des jungen Werther</cite>. In
his memoirs the old poet frankly and unreservedly
describes how, when lacerated by the conflict between
hypochondriac, suicidal thoughts and an ineradicable love
of life and cheerfulness, he resorted to the old homely
remedy of writing down his sufferings. He lays especial
stress on his desire to give definite form and body to
his vague feelings of distress. And as we read that
afterwards, when the work lay finished before him,
“bound in boards, as a picture in its frame, so as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
prove the more convincingly its individual and concrete
existence,” he could feel “free and joyful, and entitled
to a new life,” we cannot but explain this renewed courage
to live as a result of the sensation of security and
support which the beholding of external form affords.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Thus, to begin with, by its character as a palpable,
objective reality, the work of art may diminish the
subjective disturbance in which it originates. This
influence is supplemented by the retroaction of the
æsthetic qualities, in the narrowest sense of the term,
such as beauty, symmetry, and the like, by which an
artist always seeks, intentionally or unintentionally, to
arrest the attention of his public. The more therefore
the work grows in definiteness in the thought and under
the hand of the artist, the more it will repress and
subdue the chaotic tumult of emotional excitement.
The Dionysiac rapture, as the ancients would have said,
gives place to Apolline serenity. In language pruned
of mythological symbolism, this only means that art is
better able than any of the immediate expressional
activities to give complete and effective relief from
emotional pressure. And it further implies that however
earnestly an artist may strive to communicate to
his public the exact feeling he has himself experienced,
the emotional content expressed in his work will always
be of another and more harmonious character than the
mental state by which his production was originally
called into existence. To the extent that artistic form
appears in a given work or manifestation there will also
be present, independently of the subject,—cheerful or
sad, passionate or calm,—a sense of mental liberation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
which atones for the excesses of emotional excitement.</p>

<p>In a final and exhaustive treatment of æsthetic
problems this influence of artistic form would need to
be traced through all the departments of art-activity.
And it would be one of the most interesting parts of
such a research to estimate the relative power with
which art in its various branches is able to assuage at
the same time as it excites. We need not here undertake
such a thorough comparative examination of the
different arts. What has been said about literary
creation may be applied in substance to formative production
as well. And it even remains true with regard
to those most lyrical and immediately expressive arts
which seem to be altogether destitute of objective form
and intellectual content. Although it has often been
said that the lowest kinds of music are purely emotional
manifestations, we may still discern an element of form
in the rhythm which regulates even the simplest songs
and dances.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> And the creation of this form undoubtedly
requires a certain amount of conscious intention and
intellectual activity. It is therefore natural that the
intensest and most abnormally enhanced feeling should
exclude the possibility of rhythmical movement.
Exalted joy and violent despair are in their external
manifestations not only inharmonious and ungraceful,
but also unrhythmic.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> But by subjecting the expression
to the yoke of a fixed time order we may succeed
in harmonising it. And while the regular recurrence of
intervals facilitates our movements—which thereby gain
in ease and gracefulness—the vehemence of our feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
will be abated. Thus it is possible that although rhythm
powerfully reinforces musical or dramatic excitement,
it may at the same time exercise a restraining influence
on hypernormal feeling. And its effects in music and
dance show us, in the simplest and most comprehensive
of all examples, the importance of artistic form. The
musical katharsis or relief to sensation always involves
stimulation, but it may nevertheless affect us as a
sedative. The more the form-element and attention to
form gain in prominence, the more effectual also is the
relieving influence of art. Where the stimulative element
is predominant in a work of art, there the relief
is less complete.</p>

<p>This contrast, which can be observed at all stages of
artistic development, is eminently conspicuous in ancient
art, where high and low forms are often to be found in
close juxtaposition. The superiority of Greek music
over Phrygian music was a favourite topic of the old
writers on art, and the legend of the contest between
Apollo and Marsyas served as a mythological variation
on the same theme. Lyre and flute stood as symbols
for two different classes of art, of which one was violent,
orgiastic, and barbarous, while the other was calm in its
Olympian serenity.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>But the contrast expressed in these parables by the
ancient authors and some of their modern followers is
not so sharp in reality. Even the lively notes of a flute
may, to use the old metaphor, by their bound time
exercise a kind of restraining influence on the passions.
And on the other hand the sedative power of soft music
is by no means so great as has often been contended.
While acting hygienically as a cure for excess of passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
or sorrow it cannot produce any moral result properly so
called. As M. Combarieu has pointed out in his acute
criticism of Cardinal Perraud’s <cite>Eurythmie et Harmonie</cite>,
it is an incontestable fact, which has only too often been
overlooked by Platonising philosophers, that even the
most immoral feelings may be expressed in perfect
melody.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The musical, and still more the merely
rhythmical, form cannot change the quality of these
feelings; it can only deprive them of their dangerous
intensity. The mental state thereby gains in pure and
unmingled pleasure; it becomes ennobled as enjoyment,
but it is by no means moralised, at least not according
to modern views. It is only from the standpoint of a
purely hedonic system of ethics that music, or any other
art, can be said to exercise an immediate moral influence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When trying to summarise our researches on the
differences between artistic and non-artistic expression
of emotional states in a comprehensive conclusion, we
are again led to that eminently illustrative instance—the
Bacchantic condition of the ancient Maenads. We
have seen that in their description of Dionysiac mania
the classical authors enumerate almost all the various
orgiastic manifestations which can be found in all periods
in different parts of the world. And if ancient literature
affords us an epitome of the various expedients to
which the expressional impulse resorts in its endeavour
to enhance and relieve an emotional state, the force of
this craving for expression, on the other hand, nowhere
appears with such convincing clearness as in the Dionysiac
monuments of classical art.</p>

<p>The frieze around the Bacchic candelabra in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Louvre proves better than any psychological analysis to
how great a degree the Dionysiac state is alloyed with
pain and the longing for relief. If these Maenads be
compared with the figures on the great vases in the
British Museum and with the various Agave reliefs, it
will still more conclusively appear that it is real distress
which compels the dancers to seek in ever-increasing
excitement deliverance from the burden of their feelings.
No movement could be more eloquently expressive of
the corresponding psychical state than the peculiar toss
on the head and the backward curve of the upper trunk
which can always be recognised in the most violent of
the dancers. An approach to this attitude (“opisthotonos”)
sometimes appears, as Spencer remarks in his
essay on the Physiology of Laughter, in movements of
great joy, which has not been able to find expression by
the usual channels of discharge.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> But there is no doubt
that, however pleasurable the quality of the original
state may have been, its tone must have been radically
transformed before it could produce these strained
postures. A feeling which distorts the body by its
efforts to find relief, which is not satisfied with the wild
cries, the dances, and all the madness of the Bacchic
intoxication, must in its abnormal exaggeration be
perceived as a pain. The pathological character of this
feeling appears further from the fact that the very same
movement may be observed in Pierre Breughel’s paintings
of hysteric patients and in M. Charcot’s photographs
from La Salpétrière.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> And this same backward toss of
the head may be seen in sculptures of witches, the
mediæval Bacchantes, where it sometimes gives an im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>pression
of proud and insolent defiance, sometimes one
of profound melancholy.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> But in the reliefs representing
Bacchic orgies, side by side with the dancers whose
distorted attitude and violent movements betray the
pain underlying the appearance of revel and riot, there
may always be seen the figures of women moving with
easy and graceful step. The freedom of their motion
shows that they at least have found deliverance from the
oppression of overstrung feeling. The nervous tension
which in their companions manifests itself in unrhythmic,
inharmonious leapings and withings, has in their case
found relief and given place to a feeling of rest and calm.
This expression of peace in their faces, attitudes, and
draperies affords an instructive comment on the Greek
notion of Dionysos, the god of music, who, with all his
wildness is none the less able to still the tempests of
overpowering feelings.</p>

<p>This god of music, as conceived by those who gave
him a place among the Olympians, was not a symbol of
dissolute pleasure. On the contrary, the myths tell us
how those who oppose his ritual themselves fall victims
to a mania even more violent than the Bacchic frenzy
itself. His devotees, on the other hand, receive from the
stirring notes of his flute and cymbals a determinate
form and mould for their otherwise vehement and
irregular expression-movements. Their joy loses its
defiant and barbaric character, their black despair is
dissolved into gentle sadness. Rightly, therefore, was
Dionysos saluted as a deliverer when, with his merry
crew, he marched from village to village. Like him art
moves among men, ennobling their joy and blunting
the edge of their sufferings.</p>

<small>THE WORK OF ART</small></h2></div>


<p>According to an old theory the classical drama originated
in the Dionysiac cultus.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The artistic development
of savage and barbarous tribes supplies many analogies
which strongly support this view. The simplest drama
and the most primitive poetry have in most nations
been connected with orgiastic rites which, from the
psychological point of view, closely resemble the Bacchic
ceremonies. But we may go still further. It has been
contended on good grounds that even the formative arts
made their earliest appearance on the occasion of great
public festivals.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> It might seem that if this view could
only be corroborated by a sufficient body of ethnological
evidence, there would be no need of any further argument
in favour of the emotionalistic interpretation of
art. Granted that the simplest manifestations of all the
different arts served primarily as means of heightening a
festive mood, then the psychological origin of the artistic
activity ought to be ascertained by an analysis of high-pitch
feeling. The same mental causes and conditions
which called forth the most primitive manifestations of
art, and determined their character, may naturally be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
assumed to have influenced in greater or less degree the
higher forms as well. And thus in further support of
our view we might simply refer to the study of a
typical exaltation with which the preceding chapter
was concluded.</p>

<p>We have here an apparently easy solution of the
problem before us. But by resorting to it we should expose
ourselves to the risk of mistakes which is inherent
in every historical method. Not only is it impossible,
as has already been remarked, to make any positive
assertion as to the purely æsthetic and autotelic character
of a given manifestation: it is almost equally difficult
to quote a rite or practice the interpretation of which,
from the emotional standpoint, is clear and undisputed.
Even the wild antics of the Maenads, in spite of the
numerous analogies to them presented by the diseased
mental states of modern man, have been explained by
some archæologists as a stereotyped ritual. The self-wounding
and the tearing up of living animals have
been interpreted as different forms of a sacrificial cult;
the frantic gestures and songs as dramatic representations
of ancient myths.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> It would require too cumbrous
an apparatus merely to state and criticise existing theories
on this point. And even if we could prove that the
Bacchantic manifestations may be explained without
reference to religious or commemorative intentions in
the dancers, as purely emotional activities, grave objections
would still remain to be answered. From the
medical point of view it might be maintained that the
Dionysiac state, as well as all analogous conditions
among savage and civilised nations, is a purely pathological
phenomenon.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> By connecting artistic produc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>tion
with these states we should therefore expose
ourselves to the accusation of treating art as an
abnormality. And it would be of no use to appeal to
Nietzsche’s brilliant but unconvincing defence of the
position that the ancient Dionysiac orgies ought really
to be considered as splendid disorders of health and
overflowing vigour.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>It is therefore necessary to state explicitly that what
we have said about the Dionysiac state must by no
means be taken as referring to actual historic facts
known about the bacchanals. The descriptions of
Euripides and other classical authors are valuable as
expressions of the predominant notions of art quite
independently of the reality which may or may not
have corresponded to them. The corybantic mania
afforded to the Greek mind a typical simile by which
to illustrate that state of formless excitement which
precedes the artistic creation. In the mythical descriptions
of the melancholia of the Thyiads, and in the
sculptural representations of their dances and extravagances,
it was easy to recognise—more by instinct,
perhaps, than by reflection—the same dissatisfaction
and the same longing for fuller and deeper expression
which compels the artist to seek in æsthetic production
compensation for the deficiencies of life. And the
feeling of liberation, which in the artist, upon the
attainment of artistic form, supersedes overmastering
and inharmonious excitement, seemed explicable by the
analogy of the relief which the mythical Dionysus
bestowed upon his devotees. At a time, therefore,
when dancing occupied a prominent place among the
arts, it must have been quite natural to consider the
god of dance and music as an embodiment of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
feelings and impulses of artistic creation. For modern
times, however, this poetic parable has scarcely even an
illustrative value. It would be too far-fetched to treat
the simple, lyrical dance and song as a general type
of art, seeing that in real life dancing has long ago been
almost entirely superseded by more complicated forms of
artistic activity.</p>

<p>It is, however, only in such direct manifestations
as the simplest song, dance, and poetry that the artistic
activity itself is accessible to our analysis. With regard
to those higher forms of art in which the dramatic and
epic elements play an important part, it may indeed
be contended that even they originate in an emotional
craving for expression. And it can be proved, as we
have tried to show in the preceding chapters, that such
a theory gives us the best explanation of the life-preserving
influence of artistic creation. But it is not
to be concealed that, as far as painting, sculpture, and
the higher forms of poetry are concerned, this view
is exclusively based upon hypothesis. It cannot be
considered as established so long as we have no
authentic information on the feelings and impulses
which direct a sculptor or a painter in his work. The
only competent witnesses who can give us this information—namely,
the artists themselves—have generally
paid too little attention to theoretic problems to make
any observations on their own mental states during the
task of creation; and even when they do so they are
deterred by a natural sense of propriety from making
any public revelations on a matter which affects their
most intimate emotional life. All the more impertinent
would it be for an outsider to make <i>a priori</i> assertions
on the psychical motives for their work. While entitled
to speak with some confidence on the simple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
universal arts, the theoretical observer cannot, with regard
to the specialised crafts, rely upon either experience
or sympathetic understanding. The only safe point
of departure is here the objective work. Our interpretation
can be considered as conclusively established
only if we are able to show that the distinctive qualities
of the work of art, as met with in the highest manifestations
of art, are such as to provide some emotional state
with the most adequate and most convincing expression.</p>

<p>The work of art has been the subject of theoretical
investigation to a far greater extent than the artistic
impulse. When examining its distinctive qualities we
can therefore constantly avail ourselves of the researches
of earlier writers on æsthetic. There is no need to
search for the problems to be solved nor to justify the
scheme of inquiry. We have to show that our interpretation
of the artistic activity is consistent with the
general principles according to which the value of art-works
is estimated. These principles, on the other
hand, can evidently be discovered only by studying
the judgments on art which have been embodied in
æsthetical literature. Owing to the mutual contradictions
between the several æsthetic systems, such a
study is indeed not an easy one. But if minor differences
are disregarded it is not impossible to find a
common standard on which almost all writers agree.
For while the theories on art, as different from other
departments of life, have been based upon varying
philosophical assumptions, the ideal of excellence in
art has, at least in the case of all real æstheticians,
been developed under the influence of a close familiarity
with the best manifestations of living art. Notwithstanding
the ever-varying currents of taste and
the individual predilections which affect even the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
impartial judgment, it is thus possible to point to
a common fund of simple and catholic principles of
criticism.</p>

<p>As far as the lyrical forms of art are concerned we
need not dwell at any length on the æsthetic requirements
which they are generally expected to fulfil. It
is easy to understand that, however one may explain
the purpose of artistic activity and the impulse which
leads to it, the accomplished work of art must always
possess some element of sensual beauty which may
attract and hold the attention. If we were attempting
a complete treatment of all æsthetic problems we might
attempt to prove that such qualities appear to a very
great extent as unintentional by-products of artistic
expression. The perfect gracefulness, for example,
which forms the distinguishing merit of all genuine
art, is seldom a result of conscious endeavour. As,
according to its nature, pleasure is necessarily accompanied
by facilitated conditions of life, an artistic
manifestation will generally be graceful in the same
degree as it expresses pure and unmingled joy. And
even if the feeling which originally called forth a
dance, a song, or a drama is one of pain, its expression
will unavoidably acquire under the influence of artistic
form an element of ease. The freedom, and, still more,
the unconsciousness, that characterise the “inspired”
creation may thus clothe with a peculiar grace even
the representation of such mental states as in real life
manifest themselves in the most inharmonious forms.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
In the same way dignity, the quality complementary
to grace, may be deduced directly from the emotional
conditions of artistic activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>This explanation does not apply, however, to such
special qualities as, for instance, symmetry and proportion.
Neither can it be denied that these qualities
may be of incalculable importance in art as means
of heightening the effectiveness of the work. But we
hold that a problem like that of symmetry belongs to
the science of beauty rather than to the theory of art.
By a symmetrical arrangement of its parts, or by a
right proportion between them, an object may indeed
become a thing of beauty; but it acquires an artistic
character only in so far as this symmetry and proportion
perform or assist the function of expression.
Even among the most authors who lay most stress on
the paramount importance of form there are few who
contend that these abstract qualities can by themselves
bestow the title of art upon a work or a manifestation.</p>

<p>Quite different is the case of those æsthetic laws
which have been deduced from the arts of description.
As the majority of writers on æsthetic have restricted
their attention to works of art in which nature has been
imitated or represented, it is only natural that artistic
merit should be thought to depend on the relation of the
copy to the original. The most simple explanation is
undoubtedly that which is adopted by a large section
of the public, viz., that an artistic manifestation is
perfect in proportion as it gives a faithful rendering
of objective nature. For all that has been contended
by the opponents of the realistic movements which
predominated in the eighties, we do not think that
many producing authors have been guided in their
work by such narrow notions. In æsthetic literature
at least so radical a realism has been upheld only by
a few isolated authors.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Ever since Aristotle’s time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
it has been laid down that a work of art must be
something other and better than a mere copy. And
æsthetic science from its first beginning has in the
main agreed upon the general principles by which
artistic imitation attains perfection. These principles,
formulated with varying clearness in the earlier systems,
have found their most philosophical elaboration in the
works of Vischer and Taine. In his Hegelian terminology
the German author puts it that the work
of art must show us, in an æsthetic semblance, the
full and whole presence of an idea which is underlying
the things represented. In the philosophy of Taine,
which, by making science its point of departure, differs
so greatly from Hegelianism and yet resembles it so
strikingly in general character, the same thought has
been expressed in the doctrine of dominant qualities.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
If these criteria are divested of the technical garb which
makes them so inconvenient to handle, they appear to
rest ultimately on a simple observation which may be
repeated in all æsthetic experience. We find in all
descriptive art-works a subordination of qualities supposed
to be of inferior importance to what philosophers
of Taine’s school term “la faculté maîtresse.” In most
works too there may be found a relation of the represented
thing to the rest of nature, which in a Hegelian
mind may awaken the notion of a general idea behind
the individual phenomenon. But, as we have already
observed, it is a mark of excessive intellectualism to
assume that the desire to discover predominant qualities
or hidden ideas is the impelling force in art-creation.
And we shall now endeavour to show that it is equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
one-sided to consider the enjoyment of art as conditioned
by increased intellectual knowledge of individual or
universal phenomena and ideas.</p>

<p>The defects of intellectualistic art-theories are
perhaps most manifest in the system of Taine. Taine
himself seems to believe that the “faculté mère” really
exists, and that it can be not only represented by an
artistical treatment of nature, but also discovered by
scientific study; he is consequently unable to make any
proper distinction between the departments of science
and art.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> And, on the other hand, his own critical
studies show us how incompatible is the principle of
dominant faculties with a purely scientific conception of
reality. Too often, in the attempt to deduce every
manifestation and every personality from a determinate,
all-explaining and all-conditioning quality, he loses sight
of the rich variety of life, and gains instead merely a
brilliant formula. Thus, however suggestive his criticisms
may be, they are seldom scientifically exact.
There is none, however, of all his admirers who would
wish to have anything changed in his writings on art;
for we know that by this very one-sidedness, which is
the source of his scientific shortcomings, he has at the
same time attained his greatest, though perhaps unintentional,
triumphs as an artist.</p>

<p>In illustration of this we need only refer to one
instance: his celebrated description of the lion.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Objections
may be raised from the zoological point of view to
his selecting the lion as a representative of animal
strength, and from the anatomical point of view to his
deducing its whole configuration from the structure of
its jaws. But it is impossible to deny that precisely by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
such a one-sided and exaggerated portrait Taine has
succeeded in giving an expression to his admiration for
elementary force better than would have been possible
by a scientifically faithful description. Accordingly
Taine’s lion, in spite of its faults from the point of view
of science, remains a classical illustration of the æsthetic
importance of dominant qualities.</p>

<p>If we try to explain why it is that the subordination
of all characters under one “faculté maîtresse,” although
unfavourable to scientific comprehension, is nevertheless
so useful for artistic representation, we shall be
unavoidably led to that distinction between scientific
and artistic purposes which has been overlooked in the
intellectualistic systems of æsthetic. The work of art
does not claim to give us, nor do we expect to receive
from it, increased knowledge as to the real nature or
predominant characters of things and events. We only
wish to get the clearest and strongest impression of the
feelings with which an object has been contemplated by
the artist. It is therefore to the psychological conditions
for conveying a feeling-state by help of intellectual
mediation that we should look for the explanation of those
laws of artistic composition which Vischer and Taine
have interpreted in a manner exclusively intellectualistic,
and therefore unæsthetic.</p>

<p>The desire to fix a passing emotional state—in order
to facilitate either the revival of the same state or its
transmission to outsiders—by help of intellectual
elements with which the feelings have been associated,
is not restricted to the purely artistic mental processes.
In religion and in love this endeavour to evade the
transience of feeling is especially evident. And here we
may observe a selection of the intellectual elements and
a mode of treating them, which, although it cannot be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
called artistic, is nevertheless somewhat analogous to
the selective treatment of nature which takes place in
artistic representation. The institutors of religion have
all been well aware of the fact that it is not immaterial
what kind of ideas and sensations are chosen to embody
a feeling. They have understood how impossible it is
to impress an emotional state on the mind by the
mediation of complex conceptions, which, to be fully
apperceived, necessitate a particular activity of the
intellectual functions. When seeking a means of
conveying and perpetuating their deepest teaching,
they have always, more instinctively perhaps than by
any process of conscious search, been led to intellectual
notions of the simplest possible kind. A single impression
of sight, touch, or even of taste, may thus, by
artificial association, be made the bearer of an emotional
content which could not possibly be conveyed with anything
like the same fulness by a less concentrated medium.
In virtue, therefore, of their very simplicity, the vehicles
and symbols of religious ritualism are the most powerful
of all means of emotional suggestion. They offer us a
simple impression which we can easily embrace with our
senses, and by the aid of which we can infuse into our
mind a rich complex of all the moods, such as reverence,
ecstasy, and awe, which enter in the religious state.</p>

<p>In its most abnormally exalted developments love may
give rise to a fetichistic adoration of objects connected
with the beloved which is psychologically analogous
to the cults of religion. And the same tendency to
select some single representation or object as vehicle
of a psychical state, which is so manifest in the case
of these high-strung emotions, may also be noticed in
connection with feelings of lower intensity. In all departments
of psychical life we may thus find a corroboration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
of the assertion, which was already expressed by
Hemsterhuis in his speculations on our desires, which
always aim at “un grand nombre d’idées dans le plus
petit espace de temps possible.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> We need only
consult our memories—for example, of landscapes we
have seen—to find that the emotional element of the
recollection, our admiration, is always closely bound up
with some single feature of the impression. We may
indeed be able to revive the visual image itself by
allowing the mind’s eye gradually to pass along all
its details. But the subjective feelings in which we
appropriated the impression and made it our own will
not be resuscitated until we arrive at one particular
detail—a single tree, or perhaps a figure—and concentrate
our attention upon that. The experience of
this law of emotional mechanics teaches us to look with
a selective attention on everything of which we wish
to preserve a vivid remembrance. The more emotional
our intuition of a given whole, the greater is always our
desire to concentrate it upon a single impression which
supports and reconstitutes the original vision. The art
of arranging great complexes of intellectual and emotional
elements around single focal points, so to speak, may
undoubtedly be greatly developed by exercise. But the
procedure itself does not presuppose any conscious
intention. It occurs almost as an instinctive expedient
for escaping the incompatibility between diffused intellectual
attention and strong feeling. On purely psychological
grounds, therefore, we may adopt the aphorism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
of Teufelsdröckh: “For the soul, of its own unity,
always gives unity to whatever it looks on with love.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>As the artistic representation of nature, according to
our view, expressly serves the purpose of perpetuating
an emotional state, we should expect to meet with such
a unity in every work of descriptive art. And this
assumption may be amply corroborated by reference to
art-history. We need not go for examples to such
extreme schools as that of those modern French painters
who endeavour to make every line in their pictures
converge towards a point or a sharp angle. Within the
domain of universally recognised art we may observe
how the artist always tries to create a centre of gravity
by accentuating some single feature in the event, the
landscape, or the figure which serves as his model. The
principle is the same as that of which we avail ourselves
when endeavouring to preserve an emotional state in
our memory for future enjoyment. But the procedure
must necessarily be somewhat changed when the task is
added of enabling outsiders to partake of the moods we
have experienced. It is not then a matter of indifference
which particular detail of a complex impression we
single out as focal, and in which way we arrange the
bulk of the impression around this focus. Indeed, any
random quality, if it is given prominence and emphasis,
may serve as a means of attracting attention to the
work. But if one wishes to impart to spectators the
exact emotional mood, of which a given fragment of
nature acts as a representative, it is not sufficient to
attract the attention of the spectators. We must also
induce the spectators to look upon the whole of our
model from our point of view. Instead of the casual
connection by which in our own mind emotional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
memories may be bound up with some single sensation
memory, we must try to introduce a causal connection
which persuades the outsider to agree with our choice of
the focal quality. The features selected for accentuation
are to be made central, not only in the technical, but
also in the logical sense. Figuratively speaking, it is
not enough that the lines in a picture should converge
towards a certain part; this part must also appear to
the spectator as the one in which all other parts have
their cause and their explanation. Thus the artistic
imitation of nature will necessarily be connected with a
search for a predominant quality, and an endeavour to
represent this quality as a “faculté mère.” The things
and events which are selected for the embodiment of a
given emotional state become displayed in such a way
that their whole being appears to be derived from the
one quality which is most suited to represent this
emotional state. The imitation is transformed into a
construction, or rather reconstruction, by which objective
nature is adjusted so as to harmonise with the subjective
point of view.</p>

<p>Such a process of adjusting nature to the requirements
of emotional transmission need not always lead to
any definite and concrete work of art. It may also, as
an unrealised tendency, accompany our intuition. And
it is only by virtue of this creative element that the
feeling for nature may be placed on a level with artistic
production. If we are to explain, with Richard Wagner,
the æsthetic attention of the layman as the result of a
natural poetic gift (“Natürliche Dichtungsgabe”), we
cannot possibly—as he does—base the artistic value of
this attention on the fact that it is “concentrating” and
“isolating.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> For so is necessarily every emotional way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
of looking at things. Artistic treatment of nature, on
the other hand, whether abortive or carried to completion,
always involves an endeavour to make the
concentrated and isolated view acceptable to others.
As we cannot explain the creation of concrete works of
art without reference to a craving for social expression,
so we cannot distinguish the artistic from the non-artistic
intuition without assuming a tendency—unconscious
and unintentional it may be, but none the less
powerful—to socialise the emotional content, which is
connected with a given intuition. The potential poet or
painter, whose embryo work is bound to remain for ever
a fact only of his own experience, is seldom apt to
realise the purpose of his endeavour; he is not aware
that he is composing a poem or a picture for himself
as spectator or audience. Instinctively, however, he
pursues in the adjusting of his intuition an end which is
essentially similar to that of the actually creating artist.
In both these cases of creation the impelling motive is,
we believe, an emotional one. And in both cases the
creative activity aims at making an emotional mood
independent of the accidental and individual conditions
under which it originally appeared. Instead of an
intuition, the emotional content of which is concentrated
in a conventional symbol, comprehensible only to the
initiated, or in arbitrary centres of association, significant
only for those by whom they have been selected, the
artistic imagination tries to construct an intuition which,
if embodied in external form, would by its own force
impress itself, with all its accompanying emotional elements,
upon any spectator. It tends, in short, whether
consciously or unconsciously, to perpetuate and to
transmit a complex of feeling.</p>

<p>We may now understand why it is that the artistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
activity has so often been interpreted in an intellectualistic
spirit. The search for an all-conditioning and all-explaining
“faculté mère” by the help of which to convey
in the most forcible way a representation of things and
events, may, of course, easily be taken for an endeavour
to discover the real nature of these things and events.
And, in point of fact, every artist who has a true and
keen eye for nature and life will necessarily light upon
qualities which, while affording the most appropriate
centre of gravity for his representation, are, also in the
intellectualistic sense, explanatory of the subjects represented.
By making every feature of his model
converge towards this selected quality, he may thus
produce an imitation which, even if it deviates from the
visible reality, may appear truer than this reality itself.
In proportion as his representation thus convinces us of
its conformity with the actual or essential nature of
things, it will, other things being equal, elicit a readier
response from the spectator. It is only natural, therefore,
that the very works which have exercised the most
powerful influence on mankind should afford apparent
support to the views of intellectualistic philosophers.
Nor can it be wondered at that critics, in apportioning
censure and praise, have attached so great an importance
to the degree of exactness with which a work of art
represents things or ideas.</p>

<p>Such an attitude on the part of art-judges becomes
the more explicable when one takes into account the
historical conditions under which the several forms of
descriptive art have developed. Poetic and pictorial
representation have both been extensively used for
intellectual purposes. And it cannot be expected that
the essential aims of artistic activity—as they appear to
us when we theoretically distinguish this activity from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
other forms of life—should be clearly comprehended as
long as the concrete works serve a non-æsthetic purpose.
In proportion, however, as more exact and convenient
methods replace the poetic and pictorial means of thought-conveyance,
art will become freer to realise its own ends
and consequently be judged more and more on its
intrinsic merits. As rhythmic form and rhyme gained
in distinctly artistic character from the time when the
invention of systems of writing relieved them from the
mnemonic task of preserving a record of events, so
an æsthetic emancipation of the formative arts will
necessarily follow as a result of increased efficiency in
the mechanical means of recording sights. And in
point of fact recent movements in art have already
shown us how painting has grown more conscious of its
essential aims, from being compelled to give up competition
with instantaneous photography.</p>

<p>It is only the most narrow forms, however, of
naturalistically imitative art that are thus made superfluous
by scientific inventions. Those artists whose aim
is, not to attain the level of nature by servile imitation,
but to rival it by idealisation, will always be able to
point to their task of representing <i>essential</i> qualities as
one which remains for ever a prerogative of artistic
production. But there are other signs which make us
believe that even this form of intellectualistic purpose
will gradually lose importance for creators as well as for
spectators. The currents of thought which now prevail
are scarcely such as to favour the continuance of
professedly or covertly metaphysical doctrines of art.
And even if philosophical opinion, which, after all, only
has to do with the secondary justification of feelings and
impulses, had remained unchanged ever since Hegel’s
time, the changes which have taken place in the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
personality of modern man could not but exercise an
important influence on the production and estimation
of art.</p>

<p>The intellectualistic illusion that every artistic
representation has something to teach us about the
essential nature of the things represented, can only arise
on condition of there being a certain agreement between
the world-view of the artist and that of his public. It
presupposes a certain uniformity in the intellectual make
of the individual creators and spectators. This condition,
however, is fulfilled less than ever in modern
life. By the influence of the increasing division of
labour, characters become more and more differentiated;
and these different characters naturally develop different
ways of looking at things. The deviations from actual
nature which are to be met with in the work of an
individual artist have therefore a poor chance of convincing
each individual spectator that they are in
conformity with essential reality, as he is apt to conceive
it from his individual point of view. Instead of the
“eternal truths” so often spoken of in earlier æsthetic
literature, we now read about the “illusions particulières”
of the several artists. This sceptical attitude would of
course exclude all vivid æsthetic life if the motives
of artistic production and enjoyment were such as
intellectualistic authors declare them to be. It cannot
be observed, however, that the changed conceptions of
art-activity have exercised any influence on the practice
of artists. The same eagerness with which works were
created when they were thought to represent the
essential nature of things is now displayed by those who
are endeavouring to produce works which often do not
even pretend to give more than their personal impressions.
And the critical public has shown itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
ready to adopt a corresponding attitude in estimating
the value of artistic manifestations. It no longer lays
the chief stress on the intellectualistic requirement that
artistic representation should be true to nature. It
demands before all that the work of art should give
a faithful rendering of the feelings with which the
represented fragment of nature has been comprehended
by the artist. Sincerity, as involving poetical truthfulness,
thus becomes the chief claim which is set up for a
work of modern art.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the principles of art-criticism
which now prevail are too closely bound up with a
transient movement to be adduced as proof in a discussion
of art in general. When the contemporary
current of subjectivism has been succeeded by new
schools of art, the claim for objective veracity may
again acquire greater importance. We have no desire
to contend that such an evolution would be wholly
regrettable. It is impossible in estimating works of
art to put aside all logical and ethical considerations;
and attachment to truth is too ineradicable an ethical
instinct not to influence—consciously or unconsciously—our
æsthetic judgments. But although it is neither
possible nor desirable to exclude regard for intellectualistic
elements, it may be theoretically advantageous to
emphasise the distinct character of the æsthetic judgment.
Modern criticism, as it has developed under the
influence of modern subjective art, exhibits, we believe,
the essentially artistic way of enjoying and estimating
art. Although this attitude, owing to different influences,
has been now more, now less, strictly maintained
in various periods of art history, it has always been
adhered to by all who enjoy art for its own sake.
Whenever we regard a work of art without any second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>ary
motive, we are not concerned with the objective
realities which it depicts. We are not interested in
the historic Laura whose praises we read in a poem.
For all we care she may in reality have been lame, and
red-haired, and hump-backed. We are quite contented
if we receive a faithful impression of the beauty with
which she charmed her poet.</p>

<p>When it has been proved that the rules governing
the artistic adjustment of reality, which have been stated
and vindicated on the basis of intellectualistic theories,
may be equally well deduced from an emotionalistic
interpretation, the argument can easily be extended so
as to cover the principles governing the selection of
subjects and motives for artistic representation. It is
required in the Hegelian æsthetic that every single
phenomenon which is represented in a work of art
should suggest the presence of a greater and more
universal idea.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> In Goethe’s theory of style in art we
meet with the same claim—which is closely connected
with his general philosophy of nature—that every
individual form or movement should have something
to tell us about the world-process.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> And when Taine
tries to lay down a scale of gradation for the relative
value of works of art, he assigns the highest place to
those works in which the qualities exhibited are, firstly,
as remarkable and essential as possible, and in which,
secondly, these remarkable and essential qualities have
been made as predominant as possible.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> It can easily
be seen that the reasoning which is here applied to the
choice between different things is exactly the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
which was used with regard to the different features of
the same thing; and the psychological interpretation
is, therefore, also the same in both cases. As the
craving for the fullest and most adequate expression of
an emotional state influences the artist in his representation
of a given fragment of nature or life, so this craving
must also influence his selection of the model to be represented.
Owing to variations in temperament and
æsthetic predilections the relative significance of these
two aspects may be differently estimated in different
art-schools. But the main principle cannot be invalidated
by the fact that, for example, in French art
and French æsthetic the definiteness is emphasised at
the cost, perhaps, of richness, while in English art
suggestiveness is often allowed to make up for lack of
concentration.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> A catholic theory must necessarily
account for all the varying æsthetic ideals which have
influenced artistic production. Although it must be
considered as essentially non-æsthetic to contend, as Mr.
Ruskin did at one time, that “that art is greatest which
conveys to the mind of the spectator by any means
whatsoever the greatest number of the greatest ideas,”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
it must, on the other hand, be admitted that an individual
thing is adequate as a means of conveying the
fulness of feeling only if through this individual thing
there can be suggested a multitude of other things
recalled and represented.</p>

<p>Without assuming the philosophical principles from
which Taine has derived his theory of the ideal in art,
we may therefore understand and accept his scale of
gradation of the relative value of works of art. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
similarly we may interpret in an emotionalistic way all
the rules of artistic composition and of conventionalising
treatment of nature which have been proposed by
intellectualistic authors on æsthetic. The nude figure
in painting and sculpture, as well as the simple mythological
themes in poetry and literature, will thus for
ever retain their pre-eminence as subjects of artistic
treatment. But this pre-eminence does not depend for
its justification upon the fact that they give us an
incarnation of the philosophical notion of the ideal man.
It is sufficiently accounted for by their power of conveying
a fuller and richer emotional content than any
individually defined motive. Thus it can be explained
why even spectators who have almost completely outgrown—or,
if the expression is preferred, have fallen
away from—idealistic ways of <i>thought</i> are nevertheless
ready to appreciate the idealistic <i>feeling</i> in the art of
Puvis de Chavannes.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied, however, that those motives
which in the Hegelian æsthetic are considered as
beautiful <i>par excellence</i> have been relatively neglected
in modern art. To some extent this circumstance may
be explained by the notion which is gaining more and
more ground in the public mind—to wit, that in every
single phenomenon we may see a <i>résumé</i> of the whole
process of evolution. For it is evident that a spectator
who has once adopted this philosophical way of looking
at things may find even a well-represented piece of
still-life quite as rich and æsthetically saturated as a
painting of the most universal motive. A more important
cause, however, is to be found in the fact that
modern art, when endeavouring to convey large and
full contents by single vehicle-impressions, has learned
to avail itself of vehicles which cannot, properly speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>ing,
be called either typical or representative. In
literature especially we may observe that authors dwell
with instinctive predilection on the description of scenes
and events which open our eyes to large views behind
them. It would be impossible to characterise all such
favourite motives as beautiful; it is also often difficult
to show that there is any general idea embodied in
them. But they have invariably the quality of being
emotional centres, in which a multiplicity of feelings
and sensations has been united. By this quality they
become apt to serve the purposes which are essential
to the artistic craving; and by the same quality they
satisfy the requirement of fullest possible enjoyment
which is made by the spectator. What we demand of
the perfect work of art is—to resort to an often-used
image—that it shall be as a shell, which we may lift in
our hand and bring to our ear, but in which, notwithstanding
its smallness, we may hear the roaring and
singing of the sea.</p>

<small>OBJECTIONS AND ANSWERS</small></h2></div>


<p>If the preceding discussion has been to any degree
convincing, the reader may perhaps have put to himself
a question which has often presented itself to the
author—why no complete æsthetic system has been
based on the psychology of feeling. In recent times
some attempts have indeed been made to deduce the
æsthetic value of art-works from their emotional content.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
But we do not know of any comprehensive
theory in which all the distinctive features of art had
been consistently explained by reference to an emotionalistic
principle. This fact is so much the more
remarkable as the importance of feeling has been at
least accidentally acknowledged by some of the greatest
writers on æsthetic, such as, for instance, Taine and
Ruskin.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> It cannot have been without some reason
that these authors have refrained from basing their
art-theories on the notion of a craving for expression,—which
would have provided a clear line of demarca<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>tion
between æsthetic and non-æsthetic activities,—and
have instead explained art as an intellectual function,
which appears confused alternately with scientific,
philosophic, and ethical activity. An attempt to trace
the causes of this attitude will contribute to a further
elucidation of the emotionalistic theory of art.</p>

<p>It may be contended with some appearance of truth
that as soon as authors, who are themselves artists,
have pronounced their opinion on the purposes of their
own art, those who are not artists have no call to continue
the discussion. But this would be to overlook
the fact that the pure artist, as well as the purely
artistic activity, must be considered as an abstraction.
The bent of Goethe’s genius, for example, was perhaps
by nature quite as much towards science, particularly
philosophy, as towards art. Thus, although an artist
may himself lay the chief stress on the intellectual or
ethical elements in his work, his opinion should not
induce us to give up the purely æsthetic criteria which
we need for the theoretical definition of art-production
as an activity to itself.</p>

<p>It is again only natural that intellectualistic
elements should occupy the foremost place in the
practical art-ideals which artists place before themselves
and each other. Technical perfection is the only
quality which can be consciously and intentionally
aimed at. In works, therefore, which, like Herr Hirth’s
<cite>Physiologie der Kunst</cite>, are written from the point of
view of the executive artist, this quality has received
special attention.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> For those who teach it or learn it,
art must unavoidably appear as being chiefly a power
and a skill. But for the theoretical observer it is
evident that no kind of technical accomplishment, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>ever
wonderful it may be in itself, can impart to a work
that purely æsthetic merit, art-value. The differences
in the opinions of artists and theorists may therefore to
a great extent have their ground in the different aspects
of art, differently emphasised by either side to suit its
own purposes.</p>

<p>It may, however, be objected that in the case of
many artists and æstheticians it has been more than
a negative cause which has deterred them from the
emotionalistic interpretation. Goethe’s zealous championship
of the intellectualistic elements in art was no doubt
part of his crusade against prevailing sentimentalism.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
There are many expressions in the æsthetic writings of
Schiller which in their exaggeration would appear quite
incomprehensible if we did not take into account the
polemic position which he maintained towards the
romantic currents in art.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> In more recent times the reaction
against the sentimental ideals has given rise to
theories which are still more intellectualistic than the
maxims of German classicism. By their dislike of that
art which exhibits all the personal and most intimate
emotions of the artist, the French Parnassians have been
led to deny completely the part of feeling in all genuine
art; and the mere existence of such a poetic school may
be thought to prove the inadequacy of the interpretation
of art which has been put forward in the preceding
chapters.</p>

<p>The noblest expression of the personal pride that
compels the artist to conceive his production as a
purely intellectual function may be found in Leconte
de Lisle’s sonnet “Les Montreurs,” where the poet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
refuses to be a beggar for the gross pity or laughter
of the crowd.</p>

<p>Nothing could indeed be further from our intentions
than to enter the lists against the so-called Parnassian
ideas. At a time when intimate confessions seem to be
the most sought-for things in literature, we have reason
to value every appeal to the dignity of the artist. But
it is only a confusion of ideas which can lead any one to
think that this dignity would be in any way infringed
by the adoption of an emotionalistic art-theory. We
have been especially anxious not to be misunderstood on
this point, and this is the only reason why in the
preceding chapters we have taken so much pains to
disentangle the psychology of feeling, especially the
relation between simple feeling and emotions. The
word feeling, as it is used colloquially, generally involves
only the fully formed emotions, especially those which
are painful. Owing to this narrow and inadequate
usage, every one who speaks of the importance of feeling
for art exposes himself to the accusation of sentimentalism.
But it is sufficient to point out, with regard to
such misconceptions, that even pride, joy, elation, and
all the other pleasurable states, may be quite as
emotional as any sorrow or melancholy. The poem of
Leconte de Lisle, quoted above, may therefore, in spite
of all that the author himself may have objected against
such an interpretation, be considered as an expression of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
feeling. And we can in the same way point out that
in every one of the most orthodox Parnassian poems
some emotional state has been expressed by the poet
and conveyed to the reader. It is only by virtue of
this element that the poems of this school have attained
to their high poetical quality.</p>

<p>Within the department of the pictorial arts want of
precision in the use of terms has given rise to a confusion
which is even greater than that which prevails
with regard to poetry. It has been a natural result of
intellectualistic views that in every painting the subject,
the situation represented, has been considered as the
most important element. As the endeavour to give an
explanatory representation of external things and events
has been assumed as essential to the artistic craving, so
the essence of the artistic work, its real content, has
been looked for in the things and events depicted.
Especially when paintings are designated by a descriptive
title, spectators will be apt to turn their attention
solely to those situations or impressions which can be
subsumed under the title. If they cannot find any
emotional element in the subject, they declare the whole
painting to be devoid of feeling. And for this misconception
they may even find support in the utterances
of the artists; for there are many painters who,
fearing lest they might be confused with the melodramatic
sensation-mongers, have emphatically pronounced
their abhorrence of all emotional suggestion.
For the unbiassed observer, however, it is evident that
the painter’s joy over a colour or a nuance, or the
melancholy which can be expressed, without any
anthropomorphic element, by a mere relation between
light and shadow, may be as emotional states as those
which are embodied in the humorous or sentimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
subjects of genre-painting. Every artistic representation,
whether landscape, figure, or still-life, always conveys
to us some emotional mood of the painter. If
this feeling element has been conveyed in some pictures
with greater distinctness than in others, this fact must
not prevent us from acknowledging that it enters into
every kind of art. We do not say, therefore, with
Professor van Dyke, “Art to Phidias was a matter of
form; to Titian a matter of colour; to Corot a matter
of feeling;”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> but we say, Art to Phidias was a matter of
feeling expressed by form; to Titian a matter of feeling
expressed by colour; and to Corot a matter of feeling
expressed by lights.</p>

<p>In the essential unity of all feeling we may thus
find the point in which all forms of art, notwithstanding
their different subjects and materials, have their
unity. By laying the chief stress on the emotional
mood which in every work is conveyed from creator to
spectator, we save the trouble of dividing the works
into different classes. We need not then assume any
peculiar principle of admiration for technical skill to explain
the enjoyment of Dutch painting or of Greek sculpture.
Nor need we put ourselves to the pains of deciding
whether the subject or the execution is to be considered
more important. The problem of content and form,
so much debated throughout intellectualistic æsthetic,
does not exist for the emotionalistic interpretation,
which sees the essence of art in the feeling embodied,
sometimes in a great and important subject, sometimes
in some insignificant feature of nature or life. And the
element of technical perfection becomes acknowledged
in its proper light when interpreted as the indispensable
condition for effectually achieving such an embodiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>It would be impossible, however, to explain as
merely a confusion of standpoints the fact that certain
schools of art have been considered entirely unemotional.
To some extent, no doubt, the deficient appreciation of
purely pictorial art is the result of the disastrous influence
which has, especially in England, been exercised
by prevailing currents of criticism. By systematically
diverting the attention of the public from the essential
element in painting, the leaders of taste may, no doubt,
accomplish great things in deadening the art-sense of
nations. But it is scarcely probable that, even if he
knew better than to look for a “story” and literary
interest in a work of pure painting, the general spectator
would be able to enjoy the <i lang="fr">état d’âme</i> which is expressed
in an <i>intérieur</i> of Ver Meer or a landscape of Whistler.
To him a painting the whole subject of which is sunshine,
and the figures of which have no mission but
that of absorbing or reflecting the light, would appear
inane and cold. “Pictorial ideas,” which may represent
such a wealth of feeling for the initiated, are thus to the
artistically uneducated devoid of any emotional content.</p>

<p>Though emphasising as much as possible the unity
of art, we are compelled to admit that the feelings which
are conveyed in its higher and lower forms may be
essentially different. While meeting in the “lower”
art of our own and earlier times with an expression of the
most general emotions and instincts which, by the very
vehemence of their pathos, may awaken the aversion of
the refined critic, we partake, in the higher art-forms, of
feelings that can be derived only from a dispassionate
contemplation of nature. This difference between higher
and lower manifestations, though especially marked
in painting, can be observed in all forms of art. We
have no wish to deny the necessity of discriminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
between these “æsthetic feelings” of the higher art-forms
and the elementary affections, which form the
content of the sentimental, or, as the German philosophers
would say, pathological art. The moods of
æsthetic contemplation are, on the contrary, of so great
significance that we can easily understand why they
have been made the basis of so many systems of art-philosophy.
From the point of view of the present
work, which does not pretend to lay down a detailed
criterion of perfection in art, but which only aims at
explaining the most general social and psychological
aspects of art-activity, it is necessary to adhere to the
element which is common to all art, higher as well as
lower, primitive or barbaric as well as civilised. And
we can only, in passing, indicate the direction in which
we believe an explanation is to be sought for the
development of æsthetic attention and refined art-sense—those
great problems which could be properly treated
only in a separate work.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out by several authors on
æsthetic, and even emphasised to excess, that a certain
independence of the struggle for life is a condition for
the appearance of a higher art. It is indeed a current
fallacy that art must be the growth of culture and
prosperity. But it is nevertheless incontestable, that
the peculiar art-sense, the artistic intuition <i>par excellence</i>,
can be developed only in nations and individuals
who—be it by success in the struggle for life,
by advantageous circumstances, or simply by a natural
lightheartedness of their own—have grown superior to
care for life’s necessities. This factor, however, is only
a negative condition. By itself mere independence of
wants could never have taught any one to derive an ever
deeper and stronger pleasure from a thing which stands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
in no immediate relation to the primary emotions or the
primary desires of the beholder or the artist. The
æsthetic education of mankind, its growth in artistic refinement,
could not have been accomplished without the
influence of more positive factors.</p>

<p>In looking for such factors we unavoidably come to
that datum which has been carefully excluded from the
present part of our research, namely, the concrete work
of art. Whatever may have been the conditions of
their origin,—whether utilitarian or not,—poems, paintings,
and sculptures must all have occasioned exercise
of that interest and attention which is independent of
the most immediate utilitarian interests. Even if poems,
for instance, were written with a purpose primarily
historical, they must have afforded both to the poet and
to his audience the opportunity to consider them as pure
works of art. Just as moral feelings have been gradually
developed under the influence of actions which may
originally have been quite non-ethical, so the refinement
of æsthetic sense has been promoted by works of
art, which may themselves have served entirely non-æsthetic
purposes.</p>

<small>THE CONCRETE ORIGINS OF ART</small></h2></div>


<p>By explaining the art-impulse as a form of social expression
we have accounted for art-creation and art-enjoyment
as activities which have their end in themselves.
The emotionalistic interpretation supplied us with a
principle, which we were able to apply to all stages, the
lower as well as the higher, of art-development. Without
committing ourselves to any definite statements as
to the purely æsthetic and autotelic character of the
individual works of art, we felt ourselves to be right in
assuming that a desire of “expression for its own sake,”
or rather for the sake of its immediately enhancing or
relieving effects on feeling, may have operated as an
art-factor on all stages of culture, and thus have given
an autotelic value even to the lowest manifestations of
art. The driving force in art-creation became comprehensible
by this assumption; and the most distinctive
features of the creation itself could be deduced from
this psychological principle. In attempting, however,
to explain the refinement of artistic attention, we could
no longer proceed with purely psychical factors. We
were compelled to appeal to the influence exercised by
the concrete work of art. The psychological demonstration
proving inadequate, it was necessary to supplement
it by an historical argument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>It may be thought, however, that in referring to the
educative effects of the work of art we need not desert
the domain of a strictly æsthetic and psychological inquiry.
There is nothing improbable in the supposition
that the products of an activity of themselves influence
this activity, so as to bring about gradually a thorough
change of its character. From the expressional impulse,
which in the lower stages of culture gives rise to crude
and simple manifestations, there might thus be derived,
by the retroactive effects of these manifestations themselves,
an increasingly refined form of expression. But
such a sequence of tendency, however clear and consistent
it may appear at the outset, cannot possibly be
thought of as unsupported by outside influences. The
more we examine it, the more we shall find that the
series of causes is insufficient to explain the series of
effects. This view, to which we are necessarily led by
investigating any period of art-history, forces itself upon
us with particular cogency when we turn our attention
to the earliest stages of art-development.</p>

<p>Before the first work of art had been created, the
art-impulse as well as the art-sense must necessarily
have been in a very undeveloped state. The æsthetic
cravings cannot possibly have gained any consciousness
of their purposes ere they had realised themselves in
some objective works. Of these objective works, on the
other hand, it is only the simplest forms that can be
derived solely from the pure art-impulse. We may
consider a lyrical dance, or even a lyrical song, as direct
outbursts of an emotional pressure, which, if unrelieved,
would prove dangerous to the system. But we can
scarcely imagine that any human being should be able
to invent, say, a fully formed drama simply in order to
convey in the most efficacious manner the feeling by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
which he is dominated. And it is yet more difficult to
understand how the craving after social expression could
have created, merely for its own satisfaction, such highly
developed art-forms as painting and sculpture. While
we are able to derive the mental compulsion which
forces the artist to production, and the æsthetic
qualities which give their distinctive character to his
productions from the psychological notion of the art-impulse,
we are compelled to look elsewhere for the
origin and development of the concrete technical
medium of which he avails himself in fulfilling his
purpose.</p>

<p>As in this investigation we are no longer concerned
with the abstract and ideal work of art, it seems that
we may now reasonably appeal to those theories which
we before found inadequate only because they did not
account for the purely æsthetic qualities of artistic
activity. The play-impulse, the impulse to attract by
pleasing, the imitative impulse, etc., although they give
us no information as to the essentially artistic criterion,
may nevertheless have called into existence works and
manifestations which fulfil the requirements of the
several art-forms. Man may have composed dramas,
may have painted pictures, may have made poems, in
play, or out of the desire to please, or out of the
inborn taste for mimicry. In particular the play-impulse
must, as we have already admitted in the
first part of this work, be dealt with as a factor of
incalculable importance in the history of art. In his
conclusive researches on animal and human play Professor
Groos has succeeded in showing that the chief
classes of art-forms are already foreshadowed in the
various forms of experimentation—that most general
and most important kind of play which can be observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
not only among children, but even among the higher
animals.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> In the outcome of this simple and common
activity we have, it may be said, a sufficient bulk of
raw material of which the art-impulse, when once fully
developed, can avail itself in order to fulfil its own
essentially artistic purposes. And it would therefore
seem as if there were no further problem to be solved
with regard to the evolution of art.</p>

<p>Adherents of this view may, moreover, point to
the fact that, apart from all the motive factors
represented by the various non-æsthetic impulses, the
development of art has been favoured by influences
of a more passive or static character. It has evidently
been of vital importance to the evolution of architecture
and decoration that things of useful nature
have provided these arts with a kind of concrete
frame within which to display their manifestations.
The effects of this material condition are so much
the greater because with his constitutional conservatism
man—whether civilised or primitive—always
allows himself to be bound by old forms long
after he has relinquished the technical procedures which
have originally called these forms into existence. By the
scientific “biological” researches on decorative art it has
been conclusively shown how great a portion of the ornamental
“store” consists of lines and combinations of
lines which have quite automatically been borrowed
from an earlier technique. Decorative motives, which
to the uninitiated observer appear as products of
spontaneous artistic activity, thus reveal themselves to
the historical student as unintentional by-products of
work. Where earlier investigators assumed an æsthetic
composition, modern researches refer to the force of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
mental inertia and the cravings of expectant attention.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>There is no intention here to undervalue the methods
which are nowadays employed in the study of decorative
art, and which, indeed, the writer himself has endeavoured
to apply in some earlier studies on art-theory. In the
present research, however, it would be inappropriate to
trace in detail the evolution by which forms originating
in mere utility—as in basket-work—are gradually
transformed into patterns or other artistic decorations;
for this process, however fertile in effects it may be
considered, cannot account for that phenomenon which,
above all, constitutes the main object of our investigation.
Although the psychical causes adduced above undeniably
have called into existence some of the most
familiar ideas in decoration, they cannot possibly
explain the importance which decoration itself has
attained in the various human societies. And the same
remark evidently applies to all the other psychological
sources from which art may be derived. The play-impulse,
for example, no doubt suggests a concrete source,
but it can in no way explain the important position
which art occupies as a leading factor in social life. In
order to understand why even in the lowest stages of
development art has been acknowledged as a purpose
worthy of being seriously pursued, we must investigate
this activity in its connection with the most important
biological and sociological purposes of life.</p>

<p>We propose in the following chapters to examine the
most powerful non-æsthetic factors that have favoured
the origin and development of the several art-forms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
And while we are keeping in view especially such
utilitarian requirements as those of intellectual information,
of stimulation for work or war, of sexual
propitiation or of magic efficiency, we shall be compelled
to leave out of consideration all distinctively æsthetic
factors and conditions. Accordingly we shall not be
able to maintain in this historical and ethnological
inquiry the strictest æsthetic distinctions. But we
hope that the unavoidable vagueness in our terminology
will not obscure those limitations and demarcations
which have—perhaps even too laboriously—been
laid down in the first part of this work. To preserve
consistency between our inquiries into the abstract and
the concrete origins of art, it need only be stated, once
and for all, that the several works and manifestations,
as they are to be treated hereafter, are, strictly speaking,
only the raw material of art, if art is to be considered
in the purest sense as an autotelic activity.</p>

<small>ART AND INFORMATION</small></h2></div>


<p>It is well known that, in the earlier classical times,
philosophy, history, and science were inseparably
connected with poetry. And it is as familiar a truth
that pictographs and ideograms were used for writing
before phonetic signs had been invented. But it is not
enough to recall that poetry and the arts of design have
in this way been serving the requirements of intellectual
information; it can also be shown that among primitive
tribes every one of the lower art-forms—the dance, the
pantomime, and even the ornament—has been of great
importance as a means of interchanging thoughts.</p>

<p>When attempting in this chapter to take a cursory
survey of the various art-forms as used for purely
intellectual purposes, we find it most advantageous to
start with the dramatic examples. It is true that the
art of the theatre, in the modern sense of the word,
must be considered as a late, perhaps even as the
very latest, result of artistic evolution. A literary
drama, which fulfils all the claims of a work of art, is
possible only on a highly advanced level of culture, and
it has consequently by most authors on æsthetic been
considered as the latest of all art-forms.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> When dealing,
however, with the productions of primitive tribes, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
have to adopt a lower æsthetic standard. Although we
do not meet with any tragedies, nor even with any
real comedies, at this stage of evolution, we can at
least point to the fact that simple farces, pantomimes,
and pantomimic dances are to be found among tribes
which have so far been unable to create any kind of
epics, and whose lyrical poetry is restricted to a few
rhythmical phrases with no intrinsic meaning. And if
we use the word in its widest sense, so as to include
every representation by action, drama can be spoken of
as the very earliest of all the imitative arts. It was
certainly in use long before the invention of writing,
either by pictures or letters; perhaps it is even older
than language itself. As an outward sign of thought,
action is more immediate than words. Dramatic
communication does not even presuppose any conscious
intention nor any common consent. It may appear on
the side of the “speaker” as the unchecked result of the
“Einhaltsstreben,” the universal impulse to put into
gesture any idea of action which is distinctly conceived—for
instance to clench the fist at the thought of
striking—and it may be comprehended without any
effort by the audience, which by unconscious imitation
partakes of the communicated thoughts.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Such pantomimic
forms of intellectual exchange seldom indeed
occur in civilised life. The “Einhaltsstreben” in a
civilised man is generally lost during the transfer from
thought to word. Pantomimic display, which involves
an unnecessary waste of force and time, was doomed to
disappearance with the growing development of conventional
language. Moreover, the rules of propriety
tend to confine, at least in educated society, the language
of the body within as narrow limits as possible. But as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
soon as, by pathological influences, these conditions are
annulled, even civilised man necessarily falls back upon
pantomimic language. In the extreme forms of aphasia
we may thus observe how strong the mimetic impulse is
when unchecked. There is the more reason to consider
these pathological instances as in some degree typical of
the primeval methods of communication, as it is only by
assuming an earlier system of impulsive, self-interpreting
signs that we can explain the subsequent development
of conventional word or gesture-language.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>We cannot, however, argue from cases of mental
disturbance as to the original language of primitive
man. For example, even if aphasia could be considered
as a case of atavism,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> we could scarcely compare the
mimic capabilities of modern man with those of the
unknown, wordless being whose system of expressive
signs, although he were compelled to rely exclusively
upon it, cannot possibly have been brought to any
great degree of perfection. Illustrations from deaf-mutes
and from the isolated specimens of “homo
sapiens ferus”—Mr. Kipling’s Mowgli—are for the
same reason inadequate.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> As long as ethnology is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
ignorant of any wordless tribes, our notions as to the
assumed dramatic language rest entirely upon psychological
deductions.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> But the probability of these
deductions is, more or less, supported by what we know
about the lowest tribes now existing. It is true that
the information on this point is even more inconsistent
than is usual in ethnological evidence. But although
due allowance must be made for the errors into which
a deficient knowledge of the primitive custom and
languages has led the various authors, there will
nevertheless remain a sufficient body of facts proving
the important part which pantomimic communication
plays in the lower stages of mental evolution. Bushmen,
Australians, and Eskimos show us a highly developed
dramatic language.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> In some parts of Australia it has
been noticed that the store of gestures is richest among
tribes which have enjoyed the least contact with
Europeans.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> And a further ground for considering this
mode of thought-conveyance as old and primitive is
afforded by the fact that, according to Mr. W. E. Roth,
its “use is strictly enforced on certain special occasions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
such as some of the initiation ceremonies.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Mr. Fraser
also believes that gesture-language is taught at the
Bora ceremonies.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>It would, however, be presumption to see in every
instance of dramatic thought-communication a rudiment
of an old and primitive language. There are many
causes which favour the adaptation and elaboration of
mimic language even after a system of phonetic signs
has been established. In a passage which has already
been quoted Mr. Roth observes that pantomimic
ideograms must be very advantageous “on the war-path
or the chase, where silence is so essential an adjunct to
success.”<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Another reason still more important is the
fact that pantomimic action can be understood by
people who speak different languages. Among civilised
nations we may find many instances of the high state of
development which gesture-language has attained in
border countries where different peoples must necessarily
often meet.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> And it is significant that among primitive
tribes gestures and motions are nowhere so full of
significance and intellectual expressiveness as on the
plains of Australia,<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> among the savages in the interior
parts of Brazil,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and on the great prairies of North
America,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>—in a word, in countries where the breaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
up of a nation into small vagrant tribes has been the
cause of an extreme dialectical disseverance. Under
these conditions, however, the impulsive, self-interpreting
pantomime is apt to develop gradually into an elaborate
system of conventional signs. The gesture-language of
the North American Indians, for example, which consists
almost entirely of abbreviated “moves” of indication and
delineation, is no doubt eminently adapted to fulfil the
practical requirements of comprehensibility and explicitness.
But it has not much to do with dramatic art in
any sense of the word.</p>

<p>Of a more immediate importance for art-history are
the pantomimics which accompany public speaking. In
a state of society where every member is entitled to
take part in the common deliberations, oral language
will often prove an inadequate vehicle of thought.
Only through displaying his speech in action is the
chief or the priest capable of making its purport
comprehensible to the large audiences at a popular
meeting. Rhetoric, therefore, is still among many
primitive tribes what it used to be in classical antiquity—a
dramatic as well as a literary art.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>A pantomime will, of course, by virtue of its greater
vividness, convey its content of thoughts and feelings
with a far greater efficiency than a merely spoken oration.
It may, when especially infectious, induce the audience
to join in it as a dramatic chorus. And even when the
imitation which it calls forth remains purely internal,
this imitation, nevertheless, enables the spectators to
appropriate the text of the acted oration in a way which
is deeper and far more complete than could ever be
possible with regard to an oral speech. As a natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
sign of emotion pantomimic language opens, as Home
would say in his quaint way, “a direct avenue to our
heart.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> It is no wonder, therefore, that dramatic
performances on all but the highest stages of culture
have been used for political agitation as well as for
religious edification.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>We shall in the following pages, when treating of
the religious and political aspects of art, obtain a fitting
opportunity of examining these forms of drama. In the
present connection we need only refer to them as means
of further emphasising the utilitarian aspect of mimic
representation in the intercourse between savages.
After having realised how on the lower stages of culture
practical advantages as well as social and religious considerations
concur in favouring the development of
this early language, we may understand the surprisingly
high dramatic ability of primitive peoples. But while
psychological as well as sociological reasons thus confirm
us in considering dramatic action as the earliest means
of conveying intellectual information, we are nevertheless
compelled to admit that even in primitive stages the
other art-forms also may have served this purpose. In
reality it is impossible to draw any sharp distinction
between dumb-drama and primitive poetry. The pantomimic
performance will in most cases spontaneously
supplement itself with a recital, spoken or sung. In
the simple representations therefore of real occurrences
which characterise the lowest forms of narrative art
these two means of intellectual expression generally
appear together.</p>

<p>And in this connection one will also meet with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
early manifestation of pictorial art in the form of an
extempore design, which serves to bring out more fully
and clearly the content of the recital. The transition
from a delineative gesture to a contour-design is indeed
so direct and easy that it must have taken place
even among tribes on a very low plane of culture. In
some instances we can distinctly see how the one art
grows out of the other. Mr. Mallery has described a
dialogue between some Alaskan Indians, in which the
left hand is used as an imaginary drawing board upon
which lines are drawn with the index finger of the right
hand.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Herr von Steinen has observed that the natives
in Central Brazil, as soon as the gestures prove insufficient
for conveying an idea, fashion an explanatory
design in the sand.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> These designs are only a projection
on a different surface of the hand-movements with
which in their pantomimic language they describe the
outlines of the objects in the air. One is tempted,
therefore, to find in these transferred gestures the origin
of pictorial art. And such an hypothesis seems the
more probable as in some tribes—particularly among
the North American Indians—the picture-signs for
denoting things and phenomena have evidently been
derived from the corresponding gesture-signs.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> But it
is, as Professor Groos cautiously remarks, difficult to
know whether any primitive man could ever have
thought of delineating the contours of an object had he
not beforehand possessed some idea of drawing.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>out
endeavouring to solve this question of origins, it is
sufficient for our purpose to state that a kind of extempore
design, almost as spontaneous and fugitive as the
dramatic art, appears together with the mimic and
poetic representations. And we have now only to
devote our attention to these various means of information
in so far as they may give rise to a manifestation
of art, while serving the purely intellectual purpose of
conveying or elucidating a thought-content.</p>

<p>It is only natural that the requirements of practical
life should call into existence various kinds of mimic,
pictorial, or literary information which have little
whatever to do with art, even if this notion is conceived
in its widest sense. There is no reason for us
to delay our argument by enumerating pantomimics,
gestures, or paintings which aim at communicating
notices of trivial importance, such as directions about the
way to be taken by travellers, warnings with regard to
dangerous passages, etc.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Even as a purely technical
product a work is of little interest as long as its subject
is so poor and insignificant. We feel justified, therefore,
in restricting our attention to such manifestations as
present in their contents some degree of coherence and
continuity.</p>

<p>The simplest examples of purely narrative art which
fulfil the technical claims of a complete work will of
course appear when the text of the narration consists of
some real occurrence which is represented with all its
episodes and incidents. Primitive life affords many
inducements to such relation. The men who have
returned from war, or from a hunting or a fishing
expedition, will thus often repeat their experiences in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
a dramatic dance performed before the women and
children at home. Although in many cases there is
reason to suppose that even these performances may
be executed to satisfy some superstitious or religious
motive, they have undoubtedly, to a certain extent,
been prompted by the desire to revive and communicate
the memories of eventful days. Other incidents
that have made a strong impression upon the minds of
the people are in the same way displayed in pantomimic
action. It is sufficient here to refer to the
elaborate dramas “Coming from Town” performed by
Macusi children, in which all the episodes of a journey
are reproduced with the utmost possible exactness,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> to
the Corrobberrees in Queensland, in which incidents of
individual or tribal interests, such as hunting or war
adventures, but only those of recent occurrence, are
enacted,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and to the performance in a Wanyoro village,
where M. de Bellefond’s behaviour during a recent
battle was closely imitated.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> At the dramatic entertainment
held before some members of Captain Cook’s
expedition an elopement scene which had in reality
taken place some time previously was performed in
the presence of the runaway girl herself. The play is
said to have made a very strong impression upon the
poor girl, who could hardly refrain from tears when she
saw her own escapade thus reproduced.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> The imitation
of the real action was in this case evidently designed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
as punishment for the guilty spectator; and as the
piece concluded with a scene representing the girl’s
return to her friends and the unfavourable reception
she met with from them, it tended no doubt to exercise
a salutary influence.</p>

<p>This naïve little interlude, with its satirical and
moralising vein, naturally reminds us of those old farces
which candidly defined themselves as adaptations of
some “scandale du quartier.”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The wordless pantomimes and dramatic dances of the
modern savages give us no information of this kind.
But there is no doubt that a closer investigation would
reveal that a great number of the comical and heroical
episodes which, are described in ethnological literature
have had their prototypes in some incidents of recent
occurrence.</p>

<p>This opinion can only be corroborated by extending
our investigation to the other departments of narrative
art. Whatever other merits one might discover in
primitive poetry, its strength does certainly not lie in
invention. When the songs contain any narrative
element at all, it refers to some simple experience of
the day. Travel, hunting, and war afford the themes
for the simplest epical poems as well as for the most
primitive dramatic recitals.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> And any event of unusual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
occurrence will of course be made use of by the poets.
Travellers who have learned to understand the languages
of the natives they sojourn with have often observed
that their own persons have been described in impromptu
songs.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Sometimes these songs have a satirical
tendency;<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> sometimes they are composed as glorifications
of the white man.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> But there is no need to assume
either of these tendencies in every case. The mere fact
of his being a strange and new thing qualifies the
European as a fitting subject for the primitive drama
and poetry. And on the same grounds all the marvels
of civilisation—the rifles, steamers and so on—will often
be described in poetry.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> In the savage mind these
unknown facts will easily give rise to the most marvellous
interpretations. For an instance of such
apparently fantastic products of poetic imagination,
which in reality have their origin in an unavoidable
misconstruction of an unknown reality, we need only
refer to the description of Captain Cook’s ships in the
Hawaii song, which has been taken down by M. de
Varigny. The ships themselves are spoken of as great
islands, their masts are trees, the sailors are gods, who
drink blood (<i>i.e.</i> claret), and eat fire and smoke through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
long tubes (<i>i.e.</i> pipes), and carry about things which
they keep in holes in their flanks.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> It is but natural to
assume that—if researches on the origins of the subjects
were possible—the seeming richness of invention in
many similar poems could be accounted for by the
deficient observation and the faults of memory in uneducated
man. And by such researches the importance
of actual experience would be substantiated even with
regard to the art of barbaric nations. As to the
songs of the lower savages, to which we have to
restrict our attention at present, it is, as shown by the
above adduced examples, unnecessary to appeal to this
explanation.</p>

<p>Not less ephemeral than the literary subjects are
the motives of primitive pictorial art. In Herr von den
Steinen’s account of the Xingu tribes we can find some
most typical examples of such explanatory designs by
which the poetic and dramatic recitals of battles, travels,
etc., are supplemented.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Owing to their fugitive character
these simple manifestations can never be reduced
to a scientific account. But there is reason to believe
that in all parts of the world pictures have been drawn
in the air or in the sand, of which there remain no more
trace than of the gesture that is over or of the unwritten
poem that is forgotten.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that in some instances at
least there have remained traces of these ephemeral
narrations. The picture might have been drawn on
some piece of bark or cloth instead of on the sand, the
pantomime might have been repeated even after its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
subject had lost its actuality, or the text remembered
after it had served its immediate purpose in the narration.
The fugitive recital, whether pictorial, mimic, or
oral, which lives only for the moment might in this way
have become a permanent work, conveying the contents
of the narrative to future times. One would think that
as soon as such a means of preserving a record of past
events had been, intentionally or accidentally, discovered,
it would have immediately been turned to
account. There is, after all, but one step between the
impromptu dance or poem, which tells of a recent
occurrence, and the work of art, which forwards the
memory of the same occurrence to consecutive generations.</p>

<p>Ethnological science shows, however, that this distinction
is by no means a theoretical one only. There
are tribes amongst the lower savages in which the
pantomimes and dances refer only to the most recent
events. And if amongst these tribes some pictures or
some dances have been preserved from older times, they
appear to be quite isolated exceptions, the presence of
which one is tempted to attribute to accident rather
than design. It is only when we look to a higher
degree of culture that we find a commemorative art, in
the true sense of the word, appearing.</p>

<p>From the point of view of comparative psychology
this fact is easily explained. The distance between an
impromptu recital of a recent occurrence and historical
art and literature, as we understand them to-day, however
short it may appear, covers perhaps the most
momentous progress that man has made in his advancement
towards culture. Whether commemorative art is
to be considered as retrospective with regard to something
that is past, the memory of which it endeavours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
to revive, or as directed towards future generations
whom the artist would wish to make participators of
the present, it presupposes a power of conferring attention
upon matters the interest in which is not confined
to the immediate present. No psychologist would include
this faculty among the attributes of those in
the lowest stage of mental development. Ethnological
science, on the other hand, shows that it is as yet lacking
in some of the existing tribes of the lower savages. In
an æsthetic research it is of the highest importance to
know exactly when and where this attribute appears.
In the general history of art no date can be more
significant than that which marks the commencement of
a larger conception in the mind of the artist of the public
for whom he works, bringing in its train, as it does,
wider aims concerning his work.</p>

<small>HISTORICAL ART</small></h2></div>


<p>It is exceedingly difficult to decide at what precise stage
in the evolution of mankind we can first distinguish
signs of a true commemorative art. It seems pretty
evident that the lowest of the known tribes—such as
the Veddas, the Bubis, the Kubus—live exclusively in
and for the present, without any memories or traditions
as to their past. When we turn our attention, however,
to tribes in the somewhat higher condition of
culture we find that the statements of travellers are not
at one with regard to this. The Fuegians are said by
M. Hyades to lack any kind of history and tradition.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
But, on the other hand, one of their pantomimical dances
(or rather dramas) has been explained by M. Martial,
another member of the Cape Horn expedition, as commemorating
the revolt of the men against the women,
“who formerly had the authority and possessed the secrets
of sorcery.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The inconsistency between these two assertions
can, however, be explained by the fact that Hyades
evidently had in view only the oral tradition. The
interpretation of M. Martial again seems to be merely
hypothetical. Mr. Bridges, who is more competent than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
any one else to speak about this tribe, does not allude
to any commemorative element in the “Kina,” although
even he thinks that these plays, in which the parts
were formerly acted by women, are old and traditional
in their form.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>A similar inconsistency in the use of terms has no
doubt been the cause of the conflicting reports on the
traditional poetry of the Greenlanders. In his account
of their “Wissenschaften” Cranz says that they have no
heroic songs describing the doings of their ancestors.
But the very wording of this negation—“They know
nothing about them except that they were brave hunters,
and slew the old Norsemen”—shows that it can by no
means be adduced to prove complete default of oral
tradition.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> And in another passage Cranz expressly
says that the Eskimos, at their sunfeasts, praise the feats
of their ancestors.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>It is more difficult to bring into accord the various
statements concerning the Melanesians. Mr. Codrington
sees a distinguishing feature of this ethnological
group in the fact that they, in contrast to the Polynesians,
are conspicuously devoid of native history and
oral tradition.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> But this rule is evidently subject to at
least one important exception, as the Fijians are known
to celebrate subjects from their legendary history in their
choral dance-songs.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> One is led to believe, therefore,
that in some other island, also of the Melanesian group,
traditional poetry and traditional dramas may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
existed, but escaped the attention of the ethnologists.
Negative statements are never to be unreservedly relied
upon, least of all perhaps in accounts of uncivilised men.
The case of the Navajo affords an instructive and warning
example, which falls exactly within the limits of the
present investigation. In spite of the statement by Dr.
Letherman, who is acknowledged to have been a “man of
unusual ability,” that the Navajos had “no knowledge
of their origin or of the history of their tribe,”<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Dr.
Washington Matthews has been able to gather his imposing
collection of historical songs and traditional commemorative
customs.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>An incident of this kind is apt to make us sceptical
with regard to the assertion of Captain Cook, which has,
however, been unreservedly quoted by Lubbock and
Spencer, that the Maoris, a race noted for old legends
and ancient lore, in 1770 had no recollection of Tasman’s
visit to their island.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> And one is inclined to doubt the
trustworthiness of Schoolcraft’s informant when he says
that the Appalachian Indians had lost all recollection of
De Soto’s expedition.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Compared with the statements
concerning the Lenape and the Mohicans, who still
remember Hudson, and the Iroquois and the Algonquins,
who preserve traditions of the first white immigrants,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
this assertion will, in any case, lose its force as a judgment
upon the whole North American race, in which
sense it has, however, been used by Lubbock.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> On a
closer investigation the Chinooks will perhaps be also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
discharged from the unfavourable verdict passed upon
them by Kane, who could never hear any traditions as
to their former origin.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>It is safest, therefore, merely to state generally and
approximately that among the lower savages the commemorative
element is lost sight of amid the prevailing
<i>impromptu</i> productions. With higher culture the
commemorative inclination appears to become intensified.
But its growth cannot be considered as closely
accompanying the general mental evolution. Whatever
great treasures of epical poetry and literature may
some day be found amongst the Melanesians, their relative
inferiority in this respect can never be contested.
When a group like this, notwithstanding its unsurpassed
ability in formative art,—which, however, seems
to suggest a commemorative purpose,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>—can be outdone
in matters of oral history and tradition, not only by
the Polynesians but even, it would seem, by the
Australians,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> there is of course no possibility of applying
the general scheme of evolution to fix the definite
beginnings of commemorative art. <i>A priori</i> assertions
do not count in a question in which the reality defeats
the assumptions of probability in such a surprising
manner. Before the ethnological knowledge becomes
more complete no statement as to traditional art can be
accepted as definite.</p>

<p>The scantiness of reliable information does not, however,
constitute the greatest difficulty. The facts themselves,
even if their authenticity is granted, are often
liable to the most inconsistent interpretations. For an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
exact appreciation of the influence which the commemorative
impulse has exercised on the history of
art it is insufficient to enumerate examples, however
many might be found, of traditionally preserved works
of art. The really important thing is to distinguish
works which can be considered as genuine specimens
of historical art, <i>i.e.</i> as the outcome of a commemorative
intention, from the mere survivals which resemble these
in so confusing a manner. In almost every artistic
manifestation we can read a story of the past. The
tenacity with which the old forms and the old technical
procedures are retained lends a documentary value to
every ornament, picture, or poem. By authors with
a predilection for historic interpretations this record
element is apt to be considered as intentionally aimed
at. The euhemeristic view will in this way be applied
to the history of art, with results that are often as
extravagant as the mythological theories themselves.
For every detail in a dance or dramatic performance a
reason has been looked for in some event of real occurrence.
This method has its strong and sensible side—and
a very sensible one indeed—in that it does away
with the idea of a rich and creative imagination in
primitive man. It can also be applied to with great
advantage for the explanation of artistic manifestation,
which would otherwise be quite incomprehensible.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
But its use is not, any more than that of any other
general theory, to be recommended as a master-key to
all the mysteries of ceremonialism and ritual art. The
shortcomings of the method are strongly emphasised by
the fact that it has failed in cases which have been
chosen expressly for its illustration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Foremost amongst the advocates of euhemerism in
the study of ceremonial stands Captain Bourke, who
has taken up and extended to the rites and dramas of
the living savages the theory of Higgins, that all ceremonies
of antiquity were created with a view of preserving
to the memory ancient learning and ancient
traditions.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> It would be extremely unfair to accuse
this indefatigable hunter after analogies of a limited
understanding. In questions of ritualistic detail, such,
for instance, as those of the flour-sprinkling customs, his
comparative studies are not only unsurpassed as proofs
of learning, but are also full of valuable and instructive
suggestions.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The stately array of facts which he
has collected from all stages of culture does not, however,
convince any impartial reader of the correctness
of the main assertions in his books. A student of comparative
psychology, for instance, will always remember
the psycho-pathological influences which everywhere
and always tend to provoke the same sort of horrid,
scatological orgies, in which Captain Bourke has seen a
commemoration of some old, exceptional conditions of
life.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> As to the snake-dance at Walpi, which forms the
subject of his earliest great work, it cannot be denied
that some details in the rite and some of the ceremonial
paraphernalia are illustrative of a way of life which
presumably predominated amongst the prehistoric
Pueblo-Indians.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> From the dance one might therefore
reconstruct an epitomised history of the tribe, which
would supplement the tales that are told by the constructional
details of the “kiva” architecture and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
decorative adornments of the Pueblo pottery.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> But it
seems unjustifiable to adduce, as Mr. Spencer has done,
this rite as a typical specimen of commemorative
ancestor-worship.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> In attempting to explain the origin
and the purpose of the rite, the later investigators
have also on good grounds neglected to appeal to the
commemorative intention. As has been conclusively
shown by the consummate researches of Mr. Fewkes, the
snake-ceremonials are mainly and chiefly to be considered
as dramatic expressions of the water-cult, which
permeates every department in the life of the Pueblo-Indians.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
Through such an interpretation the drama is
brought into close connection with the religious system
as well as with the practical necessities of the Pueblo-Indians.
Its significance as the most important of all
the national ceremonies is easily understood, when the
rite in its entirety is regarded as only an active form of
the same prayer for rain, which is pictorially conveyed
in the sand-mosaics and in the painted ornaments of
the tribe.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Its various details, on the other hand, will
find their most unsought-for explanation when considered
as contributing to the great propitiatory purpose.
Whatever value and interest an euhemeristic
interpretation might have for a student of the prehistoric
Pueblo-life, the psycho-sociological conditions of
the rite, so to speak, can be fully comprehended only
when they are investigated in connection with the ideas
of ritual magic and religious propitiation. The same
view holds good, we believe, with regard to almost all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
the religious ceremonies of uncivilised man, although it
may be impossible to prove it in every individual case,
as the facts themselves generally are entangled in a
most exasperating manner. They must be detached
not only from the theoretical constructions of the
anthropologists, but also from the euhemeristic interpretations
of the natives themselves. The native dogmatism
will often be even more misleading than that
of the scientists.</p>

<p>It is a well-known phenomenon, which often repeats
itself, that when a higher stage of culture is reached
the original significance of a rite or a custom falls into
oblivion. The custom itself, will, however, with the
tenacious conservatism that characterises man, be
rigorously maintained long after its origin has been
forgotten. Amongst the lower savages no other justification
of these ceremonies—incomprehensible to the
participants themselves—is necessary than the oft-quoted
“our fathers did so before us.” But with
increased intellectual development there must arise a
craving for some reasonable explanation. The semi-civilised
man never cares to admit to how great an
extent his actions are automatical. Hence the rationalisation
of rites and customs,—familiar to every student
of Christian theology,—which has its beginnings even
in the higher stages of savagery. The rationalisation
most readily adopted by tribes without developed
philosophical or ethical notions is the historical one.
The simple and honest argument “because our fathers
did so” is replaced by the fictitious motive of keeping
up the memory of the doings of the fathers. When
once this reasoning obtains full power it will soon cover
the whole field of ritual life. Every incomprehensible
feature in ceremonies or customs will be explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
through reference to the past. And when knowledge
of events falls short of affording such an explanation,
popular imagination will always be prone to substitute
itself for the missing reality.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> In this way a commemorative
excuse can easily be found for every apparently
illogical action in life.</p>

<p>In fact, the creation of “etiological” or justificatory
history and mythology is by no means limited to the
department of religious ritualism. Even more trivial
actions, such as games and pastimes, will, amongst
tribes with developed historical tendencies, be connected
with imaginary occurrences, which latter will be found
to account for every detail in such games and pastimes.
With the Cherokee Indians, for example, we find a most
intricate animal story, in which the action of the bat,
the eagle, and other creatures closely correspond to the
movements of the different participators in the national
ball-play.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Although much may be said in favour
of the ingenious hypothesis of Professor Groos, who
suggests that military games, such as chess and draughts,
may have been developed from dramatic narratives of real
battles, supplemented perhaps with maps drawn in the
sand and simple symbols—stones, pebbles, etc.—representing
the various armies and soldiers;<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> and although
it may reasonably be assumed that the beasts in the
animal story of the Cherokees represents the <i>totems</i> of
some old Indian chiefs,—a story like this must be considered
as secondary, in its details at least, to the play.
More artificial still it sounds when the Moondahs in
Bengal affirm that their popular Easter-game of pushing
eggs the one against the other in reality serves as a means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
of commemorating the feats of Sing Bonga, who, with
a single hen’s egg, crushed the iron globes of his rivals.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is but seldom that the commemorative
motive shows its fictitious nature with so much
evidence as in this game. In most cases there will
always be a doubt as to whether the religious drama,
poem, or design was originally intended as a means of
conveying knowledge of some real or legendary event,
or whether the idea of these events was derived from a
simple game, a propitiative poem, or a magical design.
We have quoted some instances in which the historical
interpretation is secondary only. But there could easily
be adduced other instances in which the opposite is the
case. Ancient poems, whose historical and legendary
character is quite incontestable, may often be used as
charms in magical ceremonies.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> It seems quite impossible
therefore to pronounce any definite judgment
as to priority between myth and ceremony without
special investigation of every single case. In the department
of pictorial art it is scarcely less difficult to
separate the genuinely commemorative elements from
the close interweaving of different motives, which call
into existence a work of art.</p>

<p>Foremost in rank amongst all the works of design
and sculpture that have influenced artistic evolution
stand the likenesses of a deceased person which are
placed by the relatives on his grave or in his home.
To civilised man it is most natural to look upon these
effigies as tokens of loving remembrance by which
the survivors endeavour to keep fresh the memory
of the departed. It is also easy for us to under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>stand
that the pious feelings extended towards such
effigies may acquire an almost religious character.
There is something to be said therefore on behalf of
the view that commemorative monuments have been
the predecessors of idols proper. Lubbock, who interprets
Erman’s description of the Ostyak religion<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> in
this way, quotes in further corroboration <cite>The Wisdom of
Solomon</cite>, in which work there is to be found a detailed
account of the evolution of idolatry from memorial
images.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The probability, however, is that in pictorial
as well as in dramatic art the purely commemorative
intention belongs to the latter stages of culture. It
seems in most cases to be beyond doubt that among
the lowest tribes the images serve as paraphernalia in
the animistic rites. They are either taken to be embodiments
of the ancestors’ soul, or receptacles in which
this soul, if properly invoked, might take up its abode
for the occasion. And similar superstitious notions are
entertained, not only with regard to the monuments
proper erected on the graves of powerful ancestors, but
also with regard to such minor works as, <i>e.g.</i>, the dolls
which are often prepared by West African mothers
when they have lost a favourite child.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> The vague
and indistinct character of these images shows us also
that no intellectual record of the individual has been
aimed at. No more than the poetic effusions of regret
with which the pious survivors endeavour to propitiate
the names of the deceased, do these formative works of
“pietas” give us any information as to the personality
of him whom they pretend to represent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>This general notion, however, must not be allowed
to prevent us from admitting that among sundry tribes
of mankind the images may be historical. This is
asserted with regard to the Bongos by Schweinfurth,
and with regard to the Gold Coast negroes by Cruickshank.
The wooden effigies on the Marquesas Islands
are described by Herr Schmeltz as “constructed in
memory of celebrated members of the tribe.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The
Melanesian sculptures also, according to Codrington, are
chiefly commemorative. It must be observed, however,
that according to his own description a sort of religious
respect is paid at least to some of them.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> More undeniably
commemorative examples are to be found in
New Zealand. Although no attempt to reproduce likenesses
is made in these colossal wooden statues, they
nevertheless more nearly approach the idea of monumental
commemorative portraiture than any similar
works of primitive art. The patterns of tattooing, that
infallible means of identification amongst the Maoris,
render it possible to preserve the memories of the
individual ancestors through pictorial representation.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Not less problematic than ancestral sculptures are the
much-debated rock-paintings and engravings that can
be found in every part of the world. Herr Andree
finds a sort of learned bias in the general tendency to
look for some serious, sacred, or historical meaning
in every petroglyph. He points, very sensibly as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
seems, to the prevailing impulse of the idle hand to
scratch some figures, however meaningless, on every
inviting and empty surface. Especially at much
frequented localities—such as meeting-places, common
thoroughfares, and places of rest for travellers—where
the drawings of previous visitors call for imitation, this
temptation must be looked upon as a very strong one.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
There is no reason for regarding the savage and the
prehistoric man as devoid of an impulse, which, as we
all know, shows its strength among the very lowest and
most primitive layers of civilised society. It is unnecessary,
therefore, to find anything more remarkable
in the petroglyphs than is to be found in the familiar
pictures on walls, trees, and rocks which have been
wantonly decorated by the modern vandal. This
common-sense explanation is undoubtedly sufficient to
account for the origin of many much-debated works
of glyphic art. But however sound within its proper
limits it cannot be extended so as to give a general
solution of the petroglyph problem. It is not likely, as
Mr. Im Thurn observes, that pictures such as the rock-engravings
in Guiana, to produce which must have cost
so much time and trouble, should have their origin in
mere caprice and idleness.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>But even if the serious aspect of the petroglyphs
is granted there still remains the difficulty of determining
their special purpose. The historical explanation,
although it would appear the most natural for us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
adopt, is not to be taken unreservedly with regard to
tribes on a low degree of development. What to us
seems a sort of picture-writing might possibly serve a
purpose anything but communicative. The so-called
ideograms of the Nicobarese have, for example, according
to Herr Svoboda, for their object the distraction of the
attention of the malevolent demons from their houses
and implements<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>. When investigating the ritual,
especially the funeral ceremonies, one meets with
various specimens of similar ideography, the thought-conveying
purpose of which is deceptive.</p>

<p>By the above examples the ambiguous character
of primitive art-works has been proved almost <i>ad
nauseam</i>. It appears that every single conclusion
based upon isolated ethnological examples only is
liable to be upset after a closer study of the facts. In
order, therefore, to make any positive assertions as to
the commemorative element in art we need some safer
and more reliable grounds of argument than the inconsistent
stories of travellers. We have, in other words,
to investigate the social and psychological conditions
which, in the respective cases, speak for or against the
assumption of a commemorative impulse as a motive
for art-production. Owing to our deficient knowledge
of primitive life we are not able to rely upon these
social and psychological data in every individual case.
But we may nevertheless arrive at some broad results
which in the main tally with, and corroborate the
evidence afforded by, the majority of ethnological facts.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand why historical art holds
no high place among the lower—that is, the hunting
and fishing—tribes. Even if, as is the case in Australia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
every unusual occurrence is represented in art with a
view of keeping up its memory,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> these accidental
interruptions in a monotonous life cannot possibly
contribute to the development of an historical interest—that
is to say, a commemorative attention in the people.
When, on the other hand, we meet, in barbaric and
semi-barbaric tribes, with a flourishing traditional art,
we can also, in most cases, point to some peculiar
features in their life which have called for commemoration.
In a general survey of traditional poetry one
cannot but be struck by the great prevalence of legends
about migrations.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> As travels and incidents of travel
were found to provide a favourite subject for the
pantomimes and poems described in the preceding
chapter, so these experiences have also exercised an
important influence on the songs that have been preserved
by oral tradition. And as we meet with
numerous instances of improvised drama and poetry
called forth by so eminently interesting an occurrence
as the visit of some white people, so we can also trace
the same theme in manifestations of historical art from
dim and distorted narrations up to richly detailed
descriptions like those of the Hawajian songs or of the
Mangaian “Drama of Cook.”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The influence which
these motives have exercised on the history of art is
only in accordance with the universal laws of psychology.
Tribal memory, no less than individual memory, is
dependent for its development on some favourable
external influences that stimulate the attention.</p>

<p>It must not surprise us, therefore, that the varying
experiences of war have everywhere acted as a strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
incentive on the commemorative impulse. In this
case, however, we have to count with a factor of still
greater importance in the directly utilitarian advantage
which military nations derive from historical art.
Through recounting or representing the exploits of
earlier generations, the descendants acquire that healthy
feeling of pride which is the most important factor of
success in all brutal forms of the struggle for life. So
it has come about that historic art has everywhere
reached its highest state of development amongst
nations who have had to hold their own <i>vi et armis</i>
against neighbouring tribes, or in the midst of which
antagonistic families have fought for supremacy. The
more the social institutions have been influenced by
the customs of war, the more important is usually the
part which commemoration plays in public life. It
is highly prominent in semi-feudal Polynesia,<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> where
domestic warfare was at all times of regular occurrence;
it has developed to some extent in warlike Fiji,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> notwithstanding
the Melanesian indifference for the past;
and it has obtained the position of a state function
in military despotisms, such as the barbaric kingdoms
of Central and South America and Western Africa.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
In isolated tribes, on the other hand, whose whole
struggle has been one against nature, historical art is
generally to be found at a very low ebb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>That bygone events have been preserved in history
and art chiefly for the sake of their effect in enhancing
the national pride can also be concluded from the way
in which humiliating incidents are treated. There are,
it is true, a few isolated and unhappy tribes which
keep up some dim traditions of their inglorious past.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
Generally, however, defeats are totally ignored in the
earliest chronicles. If, however, an unsuccessful battle
should have provoked artistic manifestations, these aim
at masking the humiliation.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The ancient history of
Greece affords the most curious examples of myths
and inventions by means of which the popular imagination
contrived to conceal disagreeable truths. The
fate of Phrynichos, who was fined for having revived
the memory of the defeat at Miletus, shows that
Greece, even at a much later period, preserved the
same primitive ideas as to the <i>raison d’être</i> of historic
art. It is needless to point out to how great an extent
similar conceptions still prevail amongst all warlike
nations, civilised and barbarous alike.</p>

<p>We must not overlook the fact, however, that defeats
are often represented in unmasked form for the purpose
of stirring up a revengeful spirit. But this apparent
exception only proves the rule. By appealing to the
wounded dignity of the people, poems and dramas of
this kind serve the cravings of collective pride as
effectively—although, no doubt, indirectly—as manifestations
of the opposite order. An increased attention
to the past, with a corresponding richness of
traditional art, can also generally be found in nations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
where revenge is considered as a sacred duty bequeathed
to descendants by their ancestors.</p>

<p>When historic art is regarded as a means of handing
down to posterity a knowledge of the present, a connection
with the same group of emotions is easily
discoverable. The great works of commemoration are
all monuments of boasting. By the grandiloquent
hieroglyphs on palaces and pyramids and by the extolling
hymns that he orders to be sung in his praise,
the exultant hero endeavours to win from future
admirers a meed of praise which shall quench his
unsatisfied thirst for glorification. Even in this case,
therefore, history, in its psychological sense—that is,
the concentration of attention upon times other than
the present—has been born of pride.</p>

<p>By relying on this emotionalistic interpretation we
can explain the otherwise extraordinary development
of commemorative art amongst tribes on relatively
low stages of intellectual development. The same
explanation also accounts for the artistic value of the
primitive records. The intensely emotional element
of exultation, pride, and boasting that pervades so
many of the commemorative poems and dramas makes
this kind of history an art in the proper sense of the
word.</p>

<p>It is needless to point out expressly that literary
and formative arts may be used for conveying thought-contents
which cannot, properly speaking, be called
historical. We have restricted our attention to the
unmistakably commemorative forms, because in these
alone can the purpose of information be isolated with
any degree of certainty. By tracing the gradual
development of narrative art from those simplest
manifestations in which the work is immediately con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>nected
with the real occurrence that called it into
existence, up to the more complex forms of transmitted
art, in which distant events are represented, we have
endeavoured to keep our argument within the limits of
positive research. This safe ground we should be
compelled to abandon if we were to engage in the otherwise
so fascinating task of unearthing historical elements
in mythological tradition.</p>

<p>It seems impossible, moreover, to treat of such art-forms
as the nature-myths, the tales, and the animal
stories without bringing in those factors which should
especially be kept outside the present research—the
art-impulse, the play-impulse, or the delight in pure
invention for invention’s sake; whereas we are justified
in treating even the highest purely commemorative art
as the development of an activity which was connected
with the utilitarian end of information.</p>

<p>It must not be overlooked, however, that primitive
art offers some important and purely didactic manifestations
which have no historical purpose. Thus, among
savages and barbarians, dramatic performances, poetic
recitals, and pictorial representations often serve as
means of expounding religious or philosophical doctrines.
We need only refer to the most striking instances, such
as the Australian miracle-plays, in which the old men
enact before the boys a representation of death and
resurrection.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Although less elaborate in dramatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
detail and stage-management, the fragmentary dramas
in which the Indian shaman novitiates are supposed to
be killed and recalled to life present to us a scarcely
less interesting result of the same great thought.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> There
are indeed, especially in this later example, good reasons
for assuming that the simulated death and resurrection
are supposed to effect, in a magical way, some kind of
spiritual regeneration in the novitiates on whose behalf
the drama is performed. But while admitting this, we
may nevertheless take it for granted that an endeavour
to elucidate the doctrines of the shaman priesthood may
be combined with the magical rite in question. And
similarly, with regard to analogous ceremonies in other
tribes, we feel justified in assuming the presence of
a didactic purpose. The more the doctrinal system
becomes fixed and elaborated, the greater need will there
ensue of affording these doctrines a clear expression
in the objective forms of art.</p>

<p>What has been said about religious and philosophical
subjects in dramatical art refers equally to poems and
paintings. We have therefore to regard the requirements
of religious instruction as a factor which has
favoured the development of art in all its departments.
But we have no means of ascertaining at what precise
stage in the evolution this factor, as distinct from other
motives, began to exercise its influence. The settlement
of this special point, however, is not indispensable
to a general comprehension of the principles of art-history.</p>

<p>It is more important, from our point of view, to
determine the influence which the purely intellectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
motive of conveying with the greatest possible clearness
a thought-content, be it historical, religious, or philosophical,
has exercised on the artistic representations of
life and nature. Although of itself essentially non-æsthetic,
this purpose has nevertheless called into
existence some most important æsthetic qualities.
Especially in narrative painting we may often observe
how the virtues of exactness, explicitness, and comprehensibility
give a character of beauty to representations
which may have originated in a purely practical
intention. As has been clearly pointed out by Mr.
Walter Crane, the Egyptian hieroglyphs have reached
their “wonderful pitch of abstract yet exact characterisation”
precisely because they had the character and the
purpose of a “decorative record.” The same necessity,
viz. that “every object had to be clearly defined so as
to be recognised at once and easily deciphered,”<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> is undoubtedly
to a great degree responsible for the element
of beauty which is to be found in the pictography of
North American Indians. Practical utility has in this
way subserved the development of an attention to the
picturesque side of things. But one has only to look at
the more symbolical systems of ideographic writing,
such as the Assyrian, the Mexican, and the Chinese, in
order to understand that the intellectual requirement
by itself never would have created an <i>artistic</i> representation
of nature.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>This distinction is especially indispensable for a right
conception of the intellectual elements in poetry. It is
undeniable that some of the most important qualities in
literature were developed during the time when it was
used chiefly as a means for conveying information. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
practical considerations therein have undoubtedly influenced
the form of the oral narrative. It is evident,
for example, that the metrical and rhythmical recital
must have proved the more serviceable whenever a
thought-content was to be preserved for futurity. But
this fact gives no authorisation to those curious theories
according to which poetry was invented and developed,
thanks to its merits as a mnemonic device. It is, as
was long since remarked by Brown,<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> difficult to understand
how rhythm, numbers, and verse could have been
devised as assistance for the memory, supposing nothing
of that kind to have been existing before. And even
if we admit that they could have been invented by
accident, it is plain, when we fix our mind on the
<i>essential</i> qualities of poetry, that the use of rhythm
and metre to aid memory could only have supplied a
<i>mechanical</i> condition to facilitate the development of
poetic art.</p>

<small>ANIMAL DISPLAY</small></h2></div>


<p>In a treatment of the relation between art and sexual
life the facts must necessarily be classified under two
different headings, namely, the influence of artistic
activity upon sexual selection and the importance of
erotic motives in works of art. These two points of
view have indeed often been confounded with each
other. But it will soon appear from the following how
indispensable it is to maintain the distinction between
them.</p>

<p>In modern literature there has scarcely appeared any
treatise of the same importance, not only for the theory
of art, but also for æsthetic proper, as the chapters on
sexual selection in <cite>The Descent of Man</cite>. As is well
known, Darwin supposes a necessary connection between
beauty and art. He takes it for granted that music,
poetry, drama, and the rest chiefly aim at pleasing.
When he sees that activities and forms, which at least
technically correspond to the various kinds of art, are to
be met with not only among the lower tribes of man,
but even among some of the higher animals, he therefore
explains these forms and activities as emanating from a
conscious or unconscious endeavour to please through
beauty. And for this endeavour he finds a reason in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
the necessity of gaining preference in the favour of the
female. By endowing the female with æsthetic attention
and æsthetic judgment<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> he has been able not only to
explain the appearance of art amongst savages and
animals, but also to account for the importance of beauty
in life.</p>

<p>In the foregoing arguments we have already with
sufficient clearness pronounced our dissent from Darwin’s
primary supposition. In the chapter upon the art-impulse
we have tried to show that this tendency in its
essence is something quite different from the tendency
to “attract by pleasing.” But with all this theoretical
argumentation it has of course not been proved that
the endeavour of the males to win the favour of the
females by singing, dancing, and other similar performances
has exercised no influence on the <i>history</i> of art.
However little these activities may have to do with real
art, they might, however, have afforded a raw material to
be used by the art-impulse proper for its own purposes.
In this connection it is necessary, therefore, to discuss
the question, To what extent has æsthetic choice,
exercised by either of the sexes in selecting a mate,
favoured the development of artistic activities in the
other sex?</p>

<p>The æsthetic theory of Darwin has its chief interest
in the fact that it can be applied to the activities of
animals as well as to those of men. Darwin himself has
chosen the majority of his examples from bird life, and
his critics have generally restricted the discussion to the
zoological application of his thesis. As the data of
animal psychology are less complicated than the corresponding
facts in the mental life of man, it is in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
respect advantageous to begin with this supposed animal
art. When the illustrations are chosen from bird life
the argumentation can, moreover, be handled with a
freedom which would be impossible in discussing the
delicate questions of human erotics and sexual life.</p>

<p>The theory of an appeal to some primordial æsthetic
appreciation in the hen birds is one which, however
well it may account for the beautiful plumage of some
species and for the melodious singing of some others,
necessarily must arouse objections from the point of
view of comparative psychology. Æsthetic judgment
presupposes a certain development not only of intellectual
qualities, but also of moral self-restraint. In
other words, it might be said that attention to beauty,
whether manifested in forms or colours or sounds,
always is what Ribot calls an “attention volontaire.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
It is hard to believe that the hen really has reached
such a state of spiritual freedom that, when looking at
the finery and the antics of her rival suitors, she could
be able to bestow her attention upon the æsthetic
qualities in the display. One has only to work out into
all its details and consequences the idea of a bird who
approves or disapproves the performance, and who, after
balancing the merits of the various competitors, awards
her prize to the one nearest her ideal of beauty, in
order to realise the improbability, not to say the
absurdity, of this avian connoisseurship. M. Espinas,
who describes in detail the dilemma of the anxiously
hesitating arbiter, has added nothing to the theory of
æsthetic selection. But it may safely be said that his
illustration of the thesis acts as a caricature of it.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>The improbability of an æsthetic judgment is yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
more palpable when one considers the state of mind in
which the hen is likely to be on the occasion. It has
indeed been contended with regard to some species—as,
for instance, the satyr bird—that the hen behaves with a
perfect calm and indifference during the display of the
cock.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> But it would be undoubtedly too rash to form
any general conclusion on the ground of her outward
show in some single instances. Amongst the wood-birds,
on the other hand, the hens are known to be so excited
during the “Balz” that they can easily be caught with
the hands.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>To all these <i>a priori</i> objections there may also be
added the remark of Geddes and Thomson, that if the
females of insects and birds had really called into
existence all the detailed patterns on the dresses of their
respective males by the exercise of æsthetic selection,
they would possess more discrimination than is shown
in their predilection for any sort of gaudy-coloured
objects, such as pebbles, slips of paper, and rags.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>However great the psychological improbability of
the supposed æsthetic selection, there is still more
reason to take exception to it from an evolutionistic
point of view. The female appreciation for gaudy and
gorgeous dresses must necessarily, as Darwin himself
remarks, in many cases give rise to a plumage, as a
result of which the males become encumbered in their
movements and easily discovered by their enemies.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
Æsthetic judgment, which is in itself so incomprehensible,
would thus have been developed in a
continuous conflict with natural selection. This circum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>stance,
more than anything else, makes it indispensable
to look for some more utilitarian cause of the secondary
sexual characters and activities than the hypothetical
necessity of satisfying a sense of beauty in the female
sex.</p>

<p>By the theory that has been advanced by Wallace,
and further developed by Westermarck, the nuptial
dresses of the males have indeed been accounted for in
a simple way.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Reference to the need of recognisable
marks for every different species can explain the most
prominent characteristics in male plumage without any
appeal to an æsthetic sense. This need, together with
the equally great indispensability of protective colouring,
must necessarily give rise to precisely such brilliant
coloured spots on a monotonous or plain surface as are
so often found on the bodies of the northern birds.
The gaudier coloration of the tropical species, on the
other hand, appears as a result of their more brilliant
surroundings. Even here protective colouring often
leaves to the colour of recognition only a narrow and
limited space, on which this has to develop itself with
so much the greater intensity. In this way one can
find a reason not only for the decorations, which are
beautiful according to our standard, but also for the
inharmonious and glaring colour-combinations.</p>

<p>An adherent of sexual selection can, however, easily
object that these theories, however sound and sensible
they may be, still leave the main point in Darwin’s
thesis quite unaffected. When trying to prove the
existence of an æsthetic judgment in birds, he did not
lay so much stress upon decorative plumage itself as
upon the fact of its being displayed in the presence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
the hen. If secondary sexual characters had their only
purpose in facilitating recognition between individuals
of the same species, then these elaborate performances
would be quite superfluous. And this argument can
of course be further strengthened by reference to the
musical and dancing entertainments given by the males.
Any theory which leaves these activities unexplained
must therefore be regarded as incomplete.</p>

<p>In Mr. Wallace’s <cite>Darwinism</cite> due attention has
indeed been paid to pre-nuptial performances. But his
explanation, viz. that the dancing and singing, etc., are
only the effect of an inner impulse to movement and
activity which accompanies sexual maturity,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> can but
incompletely unriddle the problem. For the purpose of
affording an outflow to a surplus of vigour or of discharging
a nervous tension, activities of a far simpler
character would have been sufficient. As, however,
amongst birds with gorgeous plumage every movement
in the display tends towards exhibiting their splendour
with the greatest possible <i>éclat</i>, an influence upon the
hen cannot be argued away. It is, as Darwin remarks,
impossible to believe that the Argus pheasant, for
instance, should have developed precisely such a curious
and peculiar sort of dance, through which his beautiful
dress is so effectively shown forth, if this dance had
been of no effect upon its spectators.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> This effect
cannot, as has been shown above, be considered an
æsthetic one. It is also difficult to believe that the
hen, as it has been suggested, should appreciate the
secondary sexual characters as signs of greater or smaller
vital force, and thus prefer not the most beautiful, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
the most vigorous and ardent mate.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Whether it is
founded on an æsthetic judgment or on an estimation of
the force displayed, her conscious choosing seems to be
alike improbable.</p>

<p>But if it is difficult to believe that the display of the
males could call forth an intellectual activity in the hen,
such as that of comparing and valuing the merits of the
rival suitors,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> one can safely assume that it might
influence her emotional and instinctive life. And for
the production of such an effect there is no need to
suppose any intervening æsthetic activity. Considering
the close parallelism which shows itself in the development
of either sex, it would only be natural if a colour
and voice alteration in the cock, which undeniably is
dependent upon sexual ripening,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> should directly and
almost physiologically imply a reaction in the sexual
life of the hen. The more energetically the male
forces himself upon the attention of the female by the
conspicuous visual and acoustic signs of his sex, the
more powerful must necessarily be the emotional
response in her.</p>

<p>If secondary sexual characters are interpreted in this
way, as signs, by which the sex of the male is manifested
in an unmistakable manner, then one can easily understand
the influence of a prolonged display. When the
cock is exhibiting his plumes or pouring forth his notes,
and thereby impressing upon his female listener the
notion of his malehood, he cannot but produce in her an
enhanced inclination for pairing.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> She needs no æsthetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
appreciation or intellectual judgment in order to comprehend
the simple text of all his utterances. With
all her instincts and impulses she can at once grasp
the only thing she wants to know—the thing that
is brought home to her with a greater and greater
clearness during the continuation of his performance,
namely, that the passionate actor in front of her is a
mature representative of the other sex. And besides
this, the secondary sexual characters and activities tell
another tale of no less importance. If the colours and
the tones of the cock, as Westermarck has shown, are
of great consequence for facilitating from a distance
recognition between members of the same species,<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> their
biological significance is perhaps yet greater when they,
during the display before the hen, accentuate the community
of species. By virtue of her inherited constitution,
the instinctive life of the hen will be deeper stirred
the more the male is able to show that he “wears the
feathers of her tribe.”</p>

<p>It is evident that the effect upon the hen must be
greater in proportion as the sex marks and species
marks of the male are more clearly defined, and therefore
easier to perceive. Not only as means of recognition,
but also as instruments for sexual incitement, colour-patterns
with lucent points must be more advantageous
than any other system of decoration. It is easily
understood that a design like that on the tails of
pheasants and peacocks is eminently capable of attracting
the female attention to the displaying cock. But it
would be stretching the theory too far if the marvellous
“balls on sockets” were explained as nothing but
conspicuous signals, the meaning of which the hen is
able to decipher by help of her inherited instincts. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
influence of the display is amongst these species undoubtedly
strengthened by an action which is quite
independent of any sexual associations. Besides
accentuating the sex and kind of the cock, these
luminous spheres will, moreover, in virtue of their very
smallness and brilliancy, provoke a stimulation in the
mind of the hen before whom they are vibrated. To
understand this effect, it is necessary to investigate the
more general question of animal appreciation of brilliancy.</p>

<p>The powerful attraction exercised by lucent things
can be sufficiently proved by numerous instances from
the life of insects and fishes as well as of higher animals.
It is needless to dwell upon the various means by which
man has availed himself of this disastrous predilection
in order to entice animals within reach of his weapons.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
More important in this connection is the mania for
collecting lustrous objects that has been noticed in the
case of ravens, jays, magpies, jackdaws, goldfinches,
chiff-chaffs, sea-pies, etc.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> It has scarcely ever been
suggested that the thievish jackdaw is prompted by any
<i>æsthetic</i> liking for brilliant plate. But as it shows
itself amongst the atlas birds and the bower birds, this
exaggeration of the appropriative impulse has been
regarded as an indication of artistic inclination. It has
been contended that these birds not only appreciate
shining and gorgeous objects, but even understand how
to arrange them according to a decorative plan.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>No one will deny that structures, such as, for instance,
the gardens of the atlas birds, which have been depicted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
by Beccari, are most wonderful specimens of animal
industry.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> But it is undoubtedly misleading to speak of
them as artistic. As far as can be judged from the
descriptions—which are seldom complete—the arrangement
of the objects seems to be quite accidental.
Darwin has indeed collected some most eulogistic
accounts of the decorative taste of the Australian bower
bird. But he has also, candidly enough, illustrated them
with a picture, on which an irregular heap of shells and
bones is to be seen in front of the bower. And the
description he borrows from Mr. Strange is yet more
significant. To judge from this account, which is further
corroborated by the statement of Captain Stokes, the
chief interest of the birds seems to be not the arranging
of their treasures, but the playing with them. It has
been noticed that the cock of the great bower bird
amuses himself by flying to and fro in the bower
carrying a shell in his bill, which he picks up on one
side and carries to the other.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> On an anthropomorphic
interpretation such a behaviour would perhaps indicate
a desire of trying some new decorative effect. But it
seems more natural to assume that brilliant objects,
even after they have been stored up in the nest, still
exercise their irresistible attraction, and thereby tempt
the birds to repeated trifling with them. If the
supposed redecorations of the gardens be accounted for
in this manner, then there is no reason for considering
the collecting impulse in the Australian birds as anything
more than a higher development of the same
tendency which shows itself in our common magpies
and jackdaws.</p>

<p>By the Australian instances, however, the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
predilection for brilliant objects is brought into connection
with the pairing dresses of pheasants, peacocks,
and humming birds. The small and brilliant objects
with which the bower birds play during their pairing
season remind us irresistibly of the “balls on sockets”
and of the ocelli designs of the colibri.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> It is true
that the pheasants carry on their tail what the
Australian birds keep in their bill. But apart from
this unimportant difference, the display seems to be the
same in both cases. In Mr. Strange’s letter it is said
that the cock, when performing the exalted antics that
precede pairing, “runs to the bower, picks up a gaudy
feather or a spotted leaf, pours forth some peculiar notes,
and runs through the pavilion.” It is not quite clear
from this wording whether the objects really are
exhibited <i>before</i> the hen. But one may safely assume
that she in any case has paid some attention to her
consort’s performance. She has decidedly not, any
more than the pea-hen, received any sort of æsthetic
impression from the display. But the brilliancy has
undoubtedly stimulated her, as it stimulates all the other
birds quoted in this connection, in a purely physiological
way. This action, on the other hand, is sufficiently
explained by recent researches on the physiological
effects which the contemplation of concentrated lustre
produces on animal organisms. It is also well known
that objects with exactly the same qualities as the
ocelli on the peacock’s tail play an important part in
hypnotic experiments. And the primitive shamans as
well as the modern cultivators of “crystal-gazing” are
acquainted with the peculiar effects of prolonged gazing
on glass-balls or the shining surface of water. More<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
familiar still is the fascinating influence exercised by
that lustrous little globe, the human eye.</p>

<p>In all these various examples the smallness of the
object fetters the attention, and thereby makes the mind
a defenceless prey to the images, feelings, and impulses
which for the moment invade it. The lustre, on the
other hand, will, to use the language of M. Binet,
strengthen the intensity of these mental images.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> There
is no reason why these effects, which presuppose no sort
of intellectual activity, should not take place in animals
as well as in man. In the case of the peacock, therefore,
the idea “male” will imprint itself with greater and
more efficacy upon the mind of the hen when she is
exposed on every side to the twinkling eyes on the
expanded tail of her mate.</p>

<p>Even in the very cases that have been regarded as
the most incontestable proofs of a taste for the beautiful,
the influence on the hen can thus be explained as one
which directly, <i>i.e.</i> without any æsthetic mediation, has
served the interests of pairing. But it may still be
asked, Whence the need of strengthening and intensifying
the emotions in the female, which must already have
been awakened by the mere presence of the male? This
objection, however, is easily met by a reference to
the psychological aspects of pairing. Throughout the
animal kingdom the males have to conquer a resistance
from the side of the females. This instinctive coyness,
the importance of which for the maintenance of the
species is incalculable and self-evident, constitutes by
itself a sufficient cause for the supposed æsthetic
characters and activities of the males.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> It has made it
necessary for them to have a stately carriage, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
makes them bigger and more pompous than ever, and to
display their bodies in flying tricks, or dances and antics,—in
a word, to emphasise their sex as energetically as
possible by colours and tunes and movements. And
this necessity has, by means of a <i>natural</i> selection,
called forth a colouring which is not only easily recognisable
from a distance, but which also forces itself on
the senses when seen at close quarters.</p>

<p>The æsthetic judgment of the hen forms the pivot
of the whole Darwinian theory. When it has been
eliminated, it is therefore quite superfluous to controvert
the assertion, which Darwin himself would not positively
defend, that the performances of the males have
originated in an artistic endeavour.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Once granted an
instinctive coyness in the hen, which must be overcome
by every possible means, one can easily understand that
secondary sexual characters and activities would gradually
appear in the males. The expressive movements in
which they seek to relieve their nervous tension afford
a material out of which natural selection will shape, as
the most effective means of incitation, the various forms
of display, or dance, or song. As is well known,
Wallace,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Spencer,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> and Hudson<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> have even contended
that emotional pressure, or, as they put it, overflowing
vitality, by itself constitutes a sufficient explanation of
the “Balz.” In the above treatment of the question,
which in its main points accords with the conclusive researches
of Professor Groos, we have endeavoured to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
that the various sorts of display never could have reached
their special and differentiated forms if it had not been
for the necessity of overcoming female coyness. But,
on the other hand, this necessity could never have
created out of nothing all these complicated activities.
It is difficult—perhaps even impossible—to make any
general assertions about the relative importance of these
two explanations.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> The only point which it is necessary
to bring out in this connection is that a sort of nuptial
performance would have appeared amongst the males
even independently of its influence upon the hen. The
hygienic need of an outburst is one reason, and a very
strong one indeed, for such motor manifestations. But
it seems also as if their purpose ought not to be restricted
to this cathartic effect. The “lek” of the wood-birds
tends no doubt to <i>increase</i> nervous force at the same
time as it relieves the tension. M. Espinas thinks that
the males, when collecting in great numbers during the
pairing season, are led by an unconscious desire to
stimulate their feelings by the view of other equally
excited fellow-males.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Such an unconscious desire of
enhancing nervous force probably lies also behind the
inclination for brilliant objects and the trifling with them
in the bowers.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> That a sort of artificial stimulation
really is necessary may perhaps be concluded from
Brehm’s general remark about the sexual life of birds:
“The pairing is often repeated, and still more often ineffectually
attempted.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> In a private communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
to Groos, Professor Ziegler, the eminent zoologist, also
refers to the increased nervous activity which is necessary
for pairing, and the passionate preludes which precede it
in so many animals.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>By these two principles, viz. the necessity of overcoming
the instinctive coyness of the hen and that of
stimulating the nervous system of the cock, it is, we
believe, possible to account for all the secondary sexual
characters and activities which in Darwin’s theory
necessitated the hypothesis of an animal æsthetic. When
the directly physiological importance of the nuptial
preludes is acknowledged one can also, without appealing
to the effects of association, explain the occurrence of a
“lek” in birds who have already made their choice of
mate.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> And, on the other hand, we need not give up
any one of the general results at which Darwin arrived
in his researches. Although conscious selection on the
part of the hen must be denied, the fact that she consents
to couple only with the cock who has been able to stir
her feelings better than any other, constitutes a kind of
unconscious choice. It may seem unnecessary, therefore,
to lay so much stress upon the theoretical inappropriateness
of Darwin’s language. The æsthetical terms in <i>The
Descent of Man</i> could easily be exchanged for more
physiological ones without any important alteration in
the main thesis of the book. And it must even be conceded
that, owing to the extreme cautiousness which
was such a remarkable peculiarity of Darwin, this
substitution would not be required in more than a
few passages. He himself often speaks of ornamental
plumage as a means of “exciting,” or “charming,” or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
“fascinating” the females;<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> once he even restricts himself
to saying that the hens “prefer, or are unconsciously
excited by, the more beautiful males.”<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> From the biological
point of view it would therefore be pretentious
to claim any importance for this reformulation of
the Darwinian theory. But, from what must be the
dominating point of view in this work, it is by no
means unnecessary to disentangle the confusion between
æsthetic appreciation and physiological stimulation. The
æsthetic corollaries, which are the most important in
this connection, will be greatly modified as soon as the
more physiological interpretation is applied to the various
manifestations of animal art.</p>

<p>When Darwin chose to endow the hen with an
aboriginal æsthetic judgment he was at once confronted
by a difficulty which was perhaps even greater than that
of locating the beginnings of art in the animal kingdom.
The facts compelled him to admit that in some species
this æsthetic judgment seemed to be a very bad one
indeed.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> When secondary sexual characters are regarded
as signs by which the kind and sex of the males are
accentuated, this apparent inconsistency is easily understood.
The harsh cry and the inharmonious colouring
of the macaw<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> tell their tale as eloquently and convincingly
as any of the æsthetic characters of the other
birds. The roaring of the battle bump,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> the disagreeable
miauling of the peacock, and the bleating call-note of the
greenfinch<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> no doubt cause as great a pleasure in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
respective hens as is ever caused by the song of the
nightingale in his mate. That the secondary sexual characters
of the birds on the whole are so much more beautiful
than those of the mammals is not the result of any
originally higher standard of beauty with their respective
females. The superiority of the birds is quite sufficiently
accounted for by the peculiar conditions of their life,
which necessitate and call forth graceful shape as well
as graceful movements. Their gorgeous colouring, on
the other hand, is undoubtedly—as has been shown
above—to some extent at least conditioned by the
gaudy colouring of the tropical landscape. It must be
remarked, moreover, that notwithstanding their undeniable
splendour, the dresses of the birds by no means
generally fulfil the claims of tasteful composition. When
appreciating the plumage and the songs of the birds,
we usually look upon them as pieces of nature. We
admire them as we admire the woods and flowers and
every other manifestation of nature and life. This
attitude must necessarily be given up as soon as a
conscious tendency is assumed in “animal art.” When
we regard the secondary sexual characters in the manner
of Darwin—as results of an æsthetic choice—we cannot
help missing all the æsthetic qualities of harmony and
composition, which are never expected, and therefore
never missed, in the objects of nature. If the proper
distinction between art and nature is maintained, it will
be possible to combine an unabated admiration for the
marvels of beauty in bird life with a denial of “animal
art.”</p>

<small>ART AND SEXUAL SELECTION</small></h2></div>


<p>The explanation which we have given in the preceding
chapter of the pairing dresses of the birds can of course
be equally well applied to the secondary sexual characters
of man. And it holds good also, we believe,
with regard to the most primitive <i>voluntary</i> alterations
in the appearance of either sex. It is true, indeed,
that artificial embellishments or deformations, the work
of the individual himself, never can appeal so strongly
to the instincts of the other sex as those alterations
which are physiologically connected with sexual development.
But when, as is the case with most primitive
tribes, the so-called means of attraction have remained
almost unchanged during innumerable successive generations,
one may safely conclude that the instincts of
either sex will gradually grow prompt to react with
eminent force upon impressions received from such
individuals as exhibit these conventional signs of their
sex and tribe. Whether the acquired qualities are considered
as hereditary, or whether the consistency in the
predilections of all the members of the same tribe be
explained—in the Weissmannian or the neo-Darwinian
way—as a result of selection, there will always be
found in either sex a sort of constitutional liking for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
certain fixed qualities in the appearance of the opposite
sex. An appearance and a behaviour which, in the
ancestors of an individual, male or female, have stirred
the instinctive life of the opposite sex through generations
past by, must needs improve his or her chances in
courtship. The more a suitor approaches the ideal
which unconsciously, and one may say physiologically,
is embodied in the inherited impulses of every female,
the more helplessly is she exposed to the fascination of
his charms. And when, at a certain higher state of
development, the males begin to practise a selection
between rival females, they will undoubtedly be influenced
in their choice by the same sort of inherited
predilections. And there is no reason why these predilections
should be restricted to anatomical qualities—why
artificial adornments, perhaps even detached gems,
which have only been traditional during some generations,
should not influence sexual preferences in the
same direct way—that is, without any intervention of
an æsthetic judgment, as secondary sexual characters
proper influence them. This circumstance justifies us
in treating the outward physical appearance and the
conventional means of embellishing it in conjunction
with each other. An outward sign, whether natural or
artificial, which has often enough been connected with
the impression of the other sex will necessarily tend to
awaken sexual feelings.</p>

<p>For such an effect it is of course not indispensable
that these signs should have originated in an endeavour
to charm the sex. As in the foregoing chapter, we
have to keep the question of influence upon the other
sex apart from the question of the positive causes—that
is, conscious or unconscious motives, which have called
forth the various secondary sexual characters and activi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>ties.
For convenience of exposition it is advantageous
to begin with the first-mentioned phase of the problem.</p>

<p>Without as yet pronouncing any definite views as to
the aims the pursuit of which has led to the different
systems of adornment, we may safely maintain that
any conspicuous garments, independently of their ornamental
qualities, which have served to distinguish the
adult and marriageable individuals from other members
of the tribe, have been of importance as means of
attraction. According to the ingenious explanation of
Dr. Westermarck, even clothing was originally invented
not to conceal nudity, but to set it off.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> There is room,
as will be shown later on, for objecting to any definite
statement with regard to a question such as this, the
answer to which is to be sought for in several directions
at once. But there can be no doubt about the fact
that the simplest dresses, and especially those which
have been interpreted as indicating a sense of modesty,
practically accentuate the things they technically conceal.
At a stage of development where nudity is the
normal state, veiling must necessarily suggest the same
emotions as unveiling in a civilised society. As Dr.
Westermarck has been able to show, dresses are
adopted by a majority of tribes on the attainment of
puberty and on the occasions of great feasts; it is
therefore natural that they should act as powerful
sexual incitements.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> And this view receives additional
support from the arguments of its opponents. The
large collection of facts that Dr. Schurtz has quoted in
proof of his assertion that clothing originally aimed at
“the concealment of sexual differences” may of course
be interpreted with equal and, we believe, with greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
probability in the inverse sense.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> One has only to look,
for example, at some of the richly-embroidered cinctures
of the Guiana natives in order to understand that these
coverings, whatever may have been their original purpose,
can never have acted as an effective means of
diverting the attention.</p>

<p>The differences between the sexes will, however, be
emphasised not only by the special garments for which
Dr. Schurtz proposes the above-mentioned explanation,
but also by every article of dress or ornament. For
the intellectualistically prejudiced observer it is undoubtedly
most natural to consider the various kinds
of fixed or detached ornament, such as paintings
and tattooings, ribbons, laces, collars, and so on,
as means of influencing an æsthetic sense in the
spectator. But it is evidently more in accordance with
the principles of comparative psychology to assume that
all these garnitures originally had their main significance
not as beautifying things or as things of beauty
themselves, but as marks by which the personality of
the decorated man or woman was distinguished. To
illustrate this argument it is not necessary to go back
to the primitive stages. Even among civilised men,
gems and jewels, when seen on a member of the
opposite sex, have chiefly a symbolic value. In the
string of pearls which encircles a woman’s neck, or in
the gay feather of a man’s hat, the charm and fascination
of a whole human being are concentrated to a
single focus. To the lover’s attention everything that
has some connection with the beloved shines with a
borrowed light. We all know that handkerchiefs and
shoes can be adored with an almost fetichistic devotion.
All the more must a gem which is conspicuously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
carried on the body be able to imbibe and exhale the
charms of its wearer. The lyrical poetry of all ages is
there to prove the emotional value which can thus be
attached to lifeless things. And the psychology of the
emotions in its turn gives a simple explanation of the
fact that loving imagination always dwells with predilection
upon some single part of the attire of the
beloved. A small and conspicuous object which can
easily be embraced by the senses affords a vehicle
which can carry into the mind the whole complex of
feelings and impulses that are attached to the notion
of the beloved. Well knowing this law of emotional
mechanics, an intelligent woman who is anxious to
please does not cover herself with jewels and ornaments.
She prefers some single brilliant gem, which
does not so much call for admiration itself, as draw
attention to her charms and heighten the impression
which they produce.</p>

<p>It may seem very far-fetched to explain the primitive
means of attraction by reference to the art of
pleasing among modern men. But however much the
forms of courtship may have been changed by higher
development, their psychological basis is still the same
at all stages of culture. There is no need, as far as
purely erotic purposes are concerned, to embellish the
appearance; what is wanted is only to enable the
appearance itself to produce its most effectual impression.
When this point is kept in mind, it is easily
understood that ornaments such as a simple piece of
glass in the hair or a band of shells twisted around the
neck can be as charming in the eyes of primitive man
as any of the gems that are used among civilised
nations. And there is no reason to doubt that the
savage beaux and belles really have increased their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
chances by putting wooden slabs in their lips and ears,
or pins of bone through their nose.</p>

<p>In the last-mentioned cases the effect has, moreover,
been strengthened by the appearance of strangeness
that is given to the face by deforming adornments.
Eyes that might pass by with indifference an accustomed
impression, are unavoidably arrested by any
extraordinary character. As amongst the birds and
mammals, horns, accrescences, and gorgeous plumage,
independently of their possible æsthetic qualities, assist
the males in courting the females, so also amongst men
any means of correcting the normal appearance, be
it through flattening the head, filling, extracting, or
blackening the teeth, elongating the ears or compressing
the waist, will, in virtue only of its singularity, act as an
effectual instrument of charming.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> For the marriageable
individual it has evidently been advantageous to
be distinguished by these extravagant transformations,
which, as is well known, are usually inflicted at the
very time of puberty. And, on the other hand, among
individuals so distinguished, those who extort an interest
for their person by the most singular qualities
ought to have an increased chance of charming the
opposite sex. In the discussion of sexual preferences
there has been much talk of a supposed constitutional
predilection for novelty and variation. But it is undoubtedly
more in accordance with the strictly psychological
position to doubt whether, in the primitive
stages, novelty really has been appreciated for its own
sake, or whether it is only by facilitating the attention,
and thereby intensifying the impression, that it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
gained the favour of the opposite sex for one particular
male or female.</p>

<p>Whichever formula may be preferred in the interpretation,
it remains as an indisputable fact that even in
some of the higher animals an exceptional appearance
gives an advantage in courtship. It is needless to point
out to how great an extent in civilised communities man
is influenced in sexual preference by a bias for a peculiar
appearance which distinguishes the chosen one from any
other man or woman. This predilection, however, is
always neutralised by a repugnance for everything that
deviates too much from the common characteristics of
the group. The two principles which have regulated
the development of secondary sexual characters—to wit,
the necessity of marks for accentuating sex-distinction
and that of tribal signs—are thus brought into conflict
with each other. This conflict is particularly conspicuous
in the lower stages of development. Owing to
the peculiar conditions of life which prevail here, the
second principle will generally be of especial importance
among the savage tribes of mankind.</p>

<p>The observation has often been made that too great
uniformity of work impedes the development of
individual characters in physical appearance. In savage
communities, where the division of labour is almost
unknown, all men must necessarily be more or less like
one another.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Especially if the home of the tribe be
some closely defined area of uniform climatic conditions,
there will be within the tribe almost no material for
selection. Where endogamic marriage prevails, the conception
“lover,” which is transmitted from mother to
daughter, and which, by “objective heredity,” becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
imprinted on the mind of every girl that grows up in
this narrow <i>milieu</i>, must therefore be one with a very
restricted content. Alongside of this increasing predilection
for a fixed and narrowly circumscribed type
of the opposite sex there will, as its complementary
feeling, develop a strong antipathy to every feature
that diverges from this type. For the evolution of
national ideals this negative influence has been of
perhaps even greater importance than the positive
preferences.</p>

<p>It is evident that strictly endogamous marriage
customs could never be upheld in tribes which have any
intercourse with their neighbours if the social institution
were not supported by a real psychological aversion
to outsiders. It has therefore been congruous with the
advantages of society to promote in the youth the
feeling that any man or woman outside the tribe is a
being with whom no emotional exchange is to be thought
of. To make this feeling possible, on the other hand, it
is necessary that everything which is connected with the
foreigner should be held up to contempt. Their dress,
their language, their manners, and so on, have thus
been considered as something to be kept at a distance.
It is needless to point out that marriage systems are not
alone responsible for the development of this feeling.
Religious differences, so important in primitive communities,
have undoubtedly often given rise to the
common notion that people outside one’s own tribe do
not, properly speaking, belong to the human species.
Continual war induces a feeling of contempt, which in
the stronger tribe is mingled with pride and in the
weaker with bitterness, and which in both cases extends
to the smallest details of physical appearance and
behaviour. And apart from all regard to these social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
causes, the primitive man, in civilised as well as in
savage nations, is always apt to look upon everything
unusual with a feeling of scornful disdain. No doubt
such a disdain can even be coincident with exogamous
marriage customs. But it seems evident that it must
everywhere have strongly influenced sexual selection
during those unknown endogamic periods in which the
racial and tribal differences were developed and fixed.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
And it may even now be observed among living tribes
of man to how great a degree antipathy to every detail
in the outward appearance of foreigners precludes union
between members of different tribes. The national and
parochial dresses of modern peasants no doubt exercise
a great influence on the love-life of the respective boys
and girls. The most telling example that could be
quoted in this connection is the case of Savakot and
Äyrämäiset in Eastern Finland. When examining a
Savakko youth as to the reason why none of his tribe
had ever chosen a wife from among their neighbours,
Ahlqvist<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> received the characteristic answer: “Se kuin on
heillä Äyrämäisillä niin hirveä vaatteen manieri niin
siihen ei meidän pojat uskalla puuttua”—that is, As
these Äyrämä girls have such horrid dresses, our boys
do not dare to approach them.</p>

<p>This instance, although it is one of modern times
and refers to relatively civilised individuals, can no doubt
be considered as illustrative with regard to the distinguishing
marks and dresses of primitive men. The
outward signs of the tribe not only exercise a strong
attraction upon all its members; they are also for outsiders
associated with a repugnance which is perhaps
equally strong. In the same way as it has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
advantageous for the young of both sexes to have an
appearance which appeals as powerfully as possible to
the instinctive predilections of the opposite sex, it has
been necessary for them not to exhibit qualities which
could be confounded with those of the alien. The
individual who endeavours to attract attention for his
person by a conspicuous and extravagant appearance
is, therefore, narrowly restricted within the boundaries
prescribed by tribal sympathies and antipathies. The
safest expedient by which to distinguish himself from
others without outraging the national idea is, therefore,
that of exaggerating the common characteristics of the
tribe.</p>

<p>These theoretical reasonings can be amply corroborated
by ethnological facts. As early as 1814
Humboldt observed and commented upon the fact that
the deformations which appear most arbitrary generally
only tend to carry into excess some natural peculiarity
of the tribe.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> And since his time, numerous instances
have been adduced in the ethnological literature, all
pointing in the same direction. In the case of people
who blacken their teeth it has been remarked that the
dental enamel is naturally darker than usual; where
heads are artificially deformed, it is found that there
exists a general disposition to develop pointed or flat
crania; where the hair-growth is scanty, baldness is
artificially produced; and so forth.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> By exaggerating
and accentuating in their own appearance the common
qualities of the tribe, the individual males or females
have thus created a more and more differentiated
tribal type. And the inherited predilections and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
aversions of the opposite sex have, on the other
hand, by continuously influencing positive and negative
choice, contributed to the fixing of these types as
tribal ideals, not of beauty, but of sexual attractiveness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE ORIGINS OF SELF-DECORATION</small></h2></div>


<p>It is evident, as might be proved by more numerous
and detailed references than it has been possible to
adduce above, that precisely such bodily deformations,
such systems of distinguishing ornament, and such conspicuous
articles of clothing and decoration as are most
generally found among both the primitive and the
cultivated tribes of mankind have been of especial importance
as means of sexual attraction. Nothing could
be more natural, therefore, than to explain the various
forms of cosmetics as so many endeavours to work upon
the preferences—whether arising from the æsthetic sense
or from associated ideas of sexual excitement—of the
opposite sex. Such an explanation, moreover, derives
support from the assertion of the primitives themselves,
who often positively state that they dress and array
themselves for the purpose of winning the love of their
women. And it has on its side the merits of simplicity
and unity. By bringing together under one head all
the different forms of self-decorative art it disentangles
the different questions of primitive æsthetics in a most
plausible manner.</p>

<p>However alluring this uniform explanation may be
for lovers of clearness and theoretical consistency, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
must nevertheless be abandoned upon an impartial
examination of the ethnological facts. It is no doubt
conceivable that a more or less conscious desire of
acquiring the favour of the opposite sex should have called
forth all the various means of attraction. As was shown
above, they could in such a case have scarcely developed
a more effectual conformation than they really have
done. But from the effect we are not entitled to draw
any conclusion as to the intention. When considering
all the various motives, often almost incomprehensible
to the civilised mind, which govern the activities of
primitive man, one loses the confidence that is necessary
in order to accept any general explanation, however
probable it may seem. A careful and impartial examination
can only lead to the result that scarcely any
form of dress or ornament can be quoted which could
be considered with certainty as an outcome of the impulse
to attract and charm the opposite sex.</p>

<p>To begin with the class which stands in the closest
connection with sexual life, we have already shown that
all the various coverings by which primitive man conceals
his nakedness, by attracting the attention are
likely to produce a sort of sexual stimulation in the
primitive spectator.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> In some cases,—for instance that
of the dancing girdles, which are especially put on for
the occasion of erotic dances and festivals,—this stimulation
is evidently intentional.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> But it seems impossible
to assume that a knowledge of this effect can have been
the motive for the use of those phallocrypts which are
worn by the Amaxosas in South Africa, by the natives
of Central Brazil, by the Melanesians in the Admiralty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
Islands and on the north-western and south-western
coasts of New Guinea, by the Australians of north-western
Central Queensland, and by the Polynesians of
the Marquesas Islands.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> As far as we know, it is only in
Australia that these things are especially employed at
corroborees and public rejoicings.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Nor is there anything
that could attract the eye in all the simple bamboo
sheets that can be seen at the Museum für Völkerkunde
in Berlin. In some cases they have perhaps been worn
for the purely practical purpose of protecting a sensitive
part against insect bites.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> But it seems more probable,
on an examination of their shape, that they really are
intended as means of concealment in the proper meaning
of the word. There is of course no reason why they
should not be considered as fulfilling the requirements of
modesty. But even if such be their purpose now, it is
difficult to assume that they were originally called into
existence by a feeling which, from the evolutionist point
of view, one rather would consider as a product of clothes
than as their cause.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>This difficulty, however, is easily avoided by reference
to another feeling which in psychical evolution
has probably preceded the appearance of modesty. It
is perhaps impossible to decide at what stage sexual
life began to be surrounded with feelings of shame,—in
other words, in what instances one is entitled to speak
of modesty and conscious chastity. But there is no doubt
that even among the lowest savages the facts of genera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>tion
are regarded with a wonder which sometimes approaches
awe, and sometimes rises to religious respect.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
Since at a somewhat higher degree of development
phallic symbols occupy so dominant a place in religious
systems, it is only natural to suppose that the realities
represented by these symbols have been regarded by the
primitive with superstitious feelings. It is probable,
therefore, that there are many primitive tribes which, in
the same way as the aborigines of the New Hebrides,
cover themselves in the most scrupulous manner, “not
at all from a sense of decency, but to avoid Narak, <i>i.e.</i>
magic influence,” the sight even of another man’s nakedness
being considered as most dangerous.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> The large
prevalence of phallic motives in amulets and magically
protecting paintings,<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> the supposed effective sorcery of
indecent gestures, so widely used even now by the
modern Italians,<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> indicate that the organs of generation
have been universally considered as the seat of a powerful
and dangerous magic. Perhaps this superstitious
idea has even been the original source of the notion that
exposure involves the gravest offence against the honour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
of the beholder.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Sometimes, on the other hand, dread
of this supposed mysterious power may have prompted
the evolution of moral institutions, and thus indirectly
furthered the moral feelings. But it is evident that
even before any such transformation took place regard
for public safety may have induced the males to conceal
the seat of so dangerous an influence.</p>

<p>The reproductive organs, however, are not only, in
virtue of their connection with the mysterious miracle
of life, objects of superstitious awe: they themselves,
owing to the same consideration, need more than anything
else to be protected against dangerous influences.
Fear of the evil eye has thus, as Ratzel suggests, had
something to do with the origin of male and female
dress.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> And the notion of malignant looks is only one
of the superstitions that keep the savage man in a state
of constant fear. All the innumerable spirits that
populate his atmosphere constitute so many dangers,
against which he has to protect himself by every possible
means. This necessity is probably even greater for the
female sex than for the men.</p>

<p>In Messrs. Spencer and Gillen’s work on Australia
there is one passage which suggests another possible cause
for the origin of female dress. When speaking about the
souls of ancestors, which, for the purpose of reincarnation,
try to find a way to the bodies of young women,
the authors say that “spirit children are also supposed
to be especially fond of travelling in whirlwinds, and
on seeing one of these, which are very frequent at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
certain times of the year, approaching her a woman
will at once run away.”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Now, this notion that the
wind is capable of bringing about impregnation is by
no means confined to the Australian aborigines. Mr.
Hartland has been able to adduce testimonies of its
occurrence not only in savage tribes, but also among the
Romans of Virgil’s time.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> And the Hottentots have an
almost similar superstition, viz. that a pouring rain,
when falling on the naked body, promotes conception.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
The belief in the fertilising powers of sunshine, well
known from European folklore and frequently illustrated
in literature, from the Danaë legends upwards to the
mysterious warnings of Hamlet to Ophelia, can of
course be quoted as indications of the same universal
“folk-belief.”<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> It would only be natural if the women,
who so anxiously try to escape from the dangers of
fecundation that surround them on all sides in the
atmosphere, had found out the simple expedient of protecting
themselves by clothing.</p>

<p>We cannot, of course, positively assert that the
wearing of clothes was originally due to superstitious
reasons. We have only wished to point out that
such an hypothesis can be proposed and consistently
defended. It accounts not only for the especial character
of the simplest dresses, but also, which is more
important, for the fact of their being adopted only when
sexual maturity is reached.</p>

<p>There are other reasons, moreover, why this last-mentioned
circumstance, which apparently affords so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
strong support to the theory of Darwin and his followers,
cannot be adduced as decisively solving the problem of
purely decorative garments. In laying so great a stress
upon the time of life when the body is decorated for the
first time,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> the advocates of the theory of erotic propitiation
seem to have overlooked that almost everywhere
sexual maturity coincides with civic majority.
There is thus something to be said for the view that
tattooing, feather-dresses, and so on, are conferred upon
young men and women as outward signs of their
changed status. And similarly all ulterior decorations
can be explained as indications of later acquired rank.
In ethnological literature, especially in German works,
a great body of facts has been produced which speak in
favour of such an analogy between primitive ornaments
and modern signs of rank and merit.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> By relying on
this interpretation too we may often explain, without
any reference to the advantages of courtship, the fact
that in primitive races men are generally more decorated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
than women. An extreme Darwinist may perhaps
object that the proportion between the ornaments of
the sexes has been inverted since the male sex began
to practise selection. But it is to be remembered that
even now in the classes for which rank distinctions are
most important, viz. in military and diplomatic circles,
men generally are more gorgeously arrayed than
women.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> And it may further be adduced as an
exception which proves the rule that on Pelew and
Ponape Islands, where mothers give children their rank,
women are richly tattooed.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>It cannot of course be contended that man at the
lowest stages of culture could have intentionally
created a fixed system of signs for denoting rank and
merit. Anything of that kind presupposes a social
differentiation which has not yet been arrived at by all
savage tribes. In thus substituting distinction-marks
for the means of attraction one might therefore apparently
be exposed to the reproof of preferring the complex to
the simple. Such a criticism must, however, lose its
force when applied to the theories which try to trace
the development of distinctive marks back to their
most simple and primitive sources. Von den Steinen,
in whose work these questions are subjected to a
detailed study, has, with special reference to the Xingu
tribes in the interior of Brazil, succeeded in amply
corroborating the theory of Spencer that the simplest
ornaments have been trophies of war and chase. In the
feather crowns of the chiefs, for example, we may thus
see only a later development of proudly arranged spoils
of chase, by which a successful hunter proclaims his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
achievements.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> And the incised scars so common
among savage tribes can, in accordance with the same
ingenious explanation, be considered as imitations of the
glorious wounds with which eminent warriors have
been adorned when returning from battle.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>In the cases where this interpretation holds true
the chief aim of the decoration is, of course, not to
make the man more beautiful and charming, but only
to show off his skill and courage, and thus to inspire
respect and fear. It is needless to point out that
in times of war such decorations must be of eminent
advantage by inspiring their wearer with pride at the
same time that they strike his enemies with terror.
But boasting adornments are by no means restricted to
military purposes. Many apparently ornamental scars
and tattooings are probably worn as proud traces of heroic
feats performed at initiations or funeral ceremonies.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
And, to quote instances of less lofty pride, there is no
end to the cases in which gems are worn chiefly for
producing an impression of wealth.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> It would be
absurd to suppose that this show of valour or wealth
must always be addressed to women. The impulse to
ostentation has thus undeniably, independent of sexual
selection, aided in the origin of self-decoration.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for the present purpose to submit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
to a close analysis all the other theories of bodily embellishment
which oppose an unrestricted application
of the Darwinian interpretation. Suffice it to say that
facts exist which support almost every one of these views.
Thus it seems quite unquestionable that tattooings often
serve as a means of conveying intellectual information.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
Not only are exploits of valour which provide an
occasion for boasting ornament registered by incisions
on the body, but this primitive record may also be used
in order to commemorate other events that have made
a great impression on the individual in question.</p>

<p>The most instructive example of such essentially
commemorative self-decoration that is known in ethnological
literature is no doubt the tattooing of Tepane,
the native of the Eastern Island whom Dr. Stolpe met
in Tahiti. On his right fore-arm this highly interesting
individual wore a pattern which, although insignificant
at first sight, on closer examination showed itself to
be nothing less than a pictorial description of the
memorable event when the great stone idols, now outside
the British Museum, were hauled down from their
original place to the British ship which was going to
take them over sea. Among the figures on this little
historical picture Tepane himself was able to point out
the first and second officer of the <i>Topaz</i>, who, standing
somewhat apart, watched the work of the sailors.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
It is indeed exceptional to meet with such complete
realistic drawings among the “motives” of tattoo.
But there is no doubt that by symbolical representation
sights and events have often been recorded on the
body, this most primitive of all commonplace-books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>There is no default of instances showing that decoration,
fixed as well as detached, has been largely used as
a magical protection against illness, bewitching, or evil
eye.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> This superstitious intention appears with unmistakable
evidence in the decorations of the Xingu
tribes of the interior Brazil, where children and pregnant
women, <i>i.e.</i> persons who particularly need to
be guarded against malignant influences, are richly
decorated with collars of beads, teeth, bones, and so on.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
Among these Indians Professor von den Steinen was
also able to find some typical examples of the process,
which has been observed in several other tribes, by
which a cosmetic painting of the body is developed
from a purely practical greasing with earth or fat,
executed in order to preserve the skin against weather
or insect bites.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps more important still than any of the above-mentioned
motives is the one to which Herr Lippert
has called attention.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> In a nation where, owing to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
undeveloped division of labour, all people necessarily
become more or less like each other, the individual
must, he thinks, feel a strong desire to develop a fixed
ego, a personality apart, which can be distinguished
from all his fellows. This craving may perhaps, as
Lippert thinks, have something to do with the growth
of a philosophical consciousness. But it may also be
considered from a purely practical point of view. In
the same way as ornaments on weapons and implements
often serve as owners’ marks,<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> so the ornaments on the
body may serve as means of identifying, for social and
political purposes, the man who is decorated with them.
The Moko patterns of the Maoris, for instance, have in
fact been used as legally recognised marks, and copies
of them applied, instead of signatures, to documents.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
Whether the utilitarian or the more philosophic explanation
be preferred, it is evident that, even if there
had been no necessity to attract the attention of the
opposite sex, the impulse to create an appearance which
is at least to some degree personal would have led to
the different systems of embellishment. Thus among
people who wear clothes any details in dresses and
gems would be made distinctive; where the naked
body is lightly coloured, so as to make tattooing conspicuous,
distinguishing patterns would be incised;
among darker nations, on the other hand, simple scars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
would be cut; and finally, in the blackest tribes, on
whose skin not even scars stand out, modes of hair-dressing
would afford a last expedient for differentiation.
And it is evident that tribes in their intercourse with
each other would be led by the same considerations as
individuals.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Even in a fictitious unisexual mankind
there might thus have appeared precisely the same
kind of common and fixed signs by which tribes are
differentiated from each other, and of individual signs
by which members of the same tribe are distinguished
by variations from the common type. These signs
must necessarily, as was shown in the foregoing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
exercise a powerful influence on the opposite sex, and
their development may therefore have been to some
extent furthered by sexual selection. But it seems
impossible to contend that they have been invented
only for the purposes of courtship.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>We have deemed it superfluous to report in this
connection all the instances which show that among
sundry tribes of mankind self-decoration is executed
especially with a view of pleasing. For copious collections
of such facts it is sufficient to refer to the works
of Westermarck and Joest. Other interesting instances
have later been communicated by Finsch, Stirling,
Stoke, and others.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> While necessarily sceptical with
regard to theories on sexual preference as a universal,
art-creating influence, we have of course no reason to
doubt the accuracy of individual statements. From
the point of view of the present research we have only
to emphasise the fact that there is no possibility of
deciding with any certainty in how great a degree considerations
for the favour of the opposite sex have
influenced the development of self-decoration.</p>

<small>EROTIC ART</small></h2></div>


<p>When from the discouraging examination of decorative
arts as connected with sexual selection we turn our
attention to the department of poetry and drama, we
reasonably expect to attain some less ambiguous results.
In every work of literary art one should think that the
subject ought to afford some indication as to its purpose.
The dances, songs, and pantomimes of the lower tribes
are, however, in this respect not very instructive. No
doubt there can be quoted a great number of artistic
manifestations in which love is represented or described
in all its phases. But we are not thereby justified in
assuming that these dramas, pantomimes, and poems
were called into existence by the preferences of the
other sex. It would be absurd to adduce the pornographic
art of modern times as proof of sexual selection.
And it is equally absurd to cite in favour of Darwin’s
thesis travellers’ tales of indecent dances or ceremonies
in which no mention is made of the presence of the
opposite sex.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must be conceded that the
influence of sex on the evolution of art cannot, as Mr.
Spencer seems to think, be completely disproved by an
appeal to the mere fact that erotic motives occupy so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
insignificant a space in the most primitive art.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Even
if there were any certainty that the existing dearth of
information on erotic dances and poems corresponds
with a real lack of erotic art, it might still be maintained
that the favour of the other sex was the aim
of all the purely lyrical kinds of music and dance.
And the analogy with our own stage of culture might
be adduced as a witness that activities and manifestations
which in their original purpose are anything but
erotic may still be used as effective means of courtship.
War dances, for example, in which all the qualities
of the male body are displayed must of course be
eminently capable of charming the opposite sex.
Although undoubtedly called into existence by the
need of military exercise and warlike stimulation,
this kind of dramatic art may therefore have been
assisted in its development by the encouraging influence
of female spectators.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> In which cases such an
influence has operated, and how great have been its
effects, can only be determined by a close examination
not only of the works of art themselves, but also, and
chiefly, of the circumstances connected with the performance
of them. As poetry and drama on primitive
stages generally have reference to a particular occasion,
these circumstances ought to appear with greater clearness
than in the case of pictorial arts.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this research there is, however,
a great deficiency of reliable information. In the
descriptions of dances and pantomimes which can be
gathered from the literature of travel the most im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>portant
point is generally omitted—whether the performances
in question were executed in the presence of
the other sex or not. From the general records of
savage life one may indeed draw some conclusions
bearing upon this question. But these conclusions,
even when, taken apart, they seem to be sufficiently
reliable, are, when considered collectively, full of contradiction.
With regard to a great number of tribes the
strict separation between the sexes which prevails in
all phases of social life—in work as well as in amusements—provides
a negative argument against the
theory of female influence on art. This circumstance
has of course been adduced by opponents of the selection
theory; and it was Mr. Gurney’s chief objection
to Wagner’s assertion that the earliest popular dances
were erotic pantomimes.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> But the adherents of Darwin’s
theory are no less able to support their assertion
by ethnological facts. This is made obvious, for instance,
by Wallaschek’s <cite>Primitive Music</cite>, which work, as far
as we know, gives the most complete account existent
of primitive dances and pantomimes. After having
enumerated a great variety of tribes in which the
sexes are separated when dancing, the author says,
“As a rule, however, both sexes dance together.”
And he then corroborates this statement by a still
greater number of instances in which dances, often
of a decidedly erotic character, are performed either
by both sexes together or by one sex before the
other.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Thus facts confront facts in a most bewildering
contradiction which is indeed trying to the believer
in ethnological argumentation. No sound statistician<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
would base any conclusions on majorities made up of
such confused masses of contradictory instances. The
question of sex influence on art would therefore be
for ever undecided if there were no expedient for
classifying the units and balancing them against each
other in greater groups.</p>

<p>Such a classification is of course no less possible
than it is necessary. But it presupposes a close
examination of every single instance quoted. Owing
to our insufficient knowledge of some of the most
interesting tribes, a satisfactory arrangement is therefore
as yet involved in great difficulty. In this work,
at any rate, it would not be possible to enter into all
these detailed researches. We shall restrict ourselves
to a few short indications of the mode in which we
think that this much-debated question is to be solved.</p>

<p>In all that has been written against Darwin’s
<cite>Descent of Man</cite> there is perhaps nothing that is so
relevant to the main issue as Mr. Hudson’s criticism.
He observes that Darwin has gathered together from
all regions of the globe unconnected facts about various
species without closely examining the habits and actions
of these species.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> It goes without saying that such an
examination would be extremely difficult with regard
to animals, the social life of which is as yet so insufficiently
known. For one not a zoologist, at least, it
would be too audacious to present any classification of
the instances, and therefore we did not even mention
this possibility in the treatment of animal art. In this
connection, however, one may suggest, without positively
asserting, that perhaps even the animal manifestations
of dance and music may be classified in groups which
correspond to the prevailing social conditions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
respective species. There is at least a striking similarity
between the types of song, serene with all their
passion, with which the males of the monogamous
songsters entertain their mates—those mates which, if
one may believe the brothers Müller, have been chosen
even before the pairing season.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> And, on the other
hand, these graceful and harmonious utterances stand
in the strongest contrast to the vehement display of
promiscuous wood-birds and polygamous fowl.</p>

<p>However presumptuous it may be to draw any
general conclusions from these coincidences, it is evidently
indispensable, when treating of sexual selection
in man, to look for some connection between the various
forms of courtship and prevailing social institutions.
This necessity was fully understood by Darwin himself.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
But it has been too much overlooked by his successors, who,
when discussing his thesis, have defended or attacked
it by promiscuous collections of facts in which barbaric
Malays and degenerate Polynesians are quoted alongside
primitives like the Veddas and Fuegians. If this confusion
is disentangled by a proper arrangement of the
instances according to stages of culture, the seeming inconsistency
of the ethnological evidence will be removed.</p>

<p>There is a <i>prima facie</i> ground for believing that
the employment of art for gaining the favour of the
other sex is characteristic of a certain advance in
social development. The tribes in which we have most
reason to suppose that the practice of self-decoration
does not rest on political or religious grounds, and may
thus aim exclusively at pleasing, are to be found among
the Polynesians, the Malays, and some of the nations
of India. From Polynesia also Berchon derived his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
chief support for the curious assertion—which seems
to be true of scarcely any other ethnological province—that
the patterns used in tattooing are quite indifferent,
provided only that they effectually embellish the decorated
part of the body;<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> in short, that tattooing has a
purely decorative purpose. With regard to dancing,
there also is practised in Tahiti, by the dramatic society
of the Areoi, a dance most typical of the kind which
aims at an erotic excitement in the spectators.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>As is well known, the “oriental” dancing, such as
is performed in the barbaric Negro states and in the
Mohammedan communities of Northern Africa, as well
as in Persia, Turkey, China, and Japan, is mainly a
gross pantomime of physical love executed by a woman
to the delight of her male spectators.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> In most of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
cases, however, the dancers are outcast women, who are
paid with money for their performance.</p>

<p>Somewhat closer, it seems, is the connection between
erotic dance and sexual selection in the native population
of the East Indian Islands.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> And finally, among the
aboriginal tribes of India, the Mundaris, Rasas, Kolhs,
Sonthals, Bhuiyas, Chukmas, and Khyoungthas, courtship
is pervaded by art and æsthetic activities.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> In
some of the villages there still survives the same kind of
romantic love-making which is so well known from
the old Indian poems and tales. The Bhuiya youths
pay visits to the camp of the girls, and are received by
them with dances and songs; and, says Mr. Dalton,
“after such daylong festivals the morning dawns on
more than one pair of pledged lovers.”<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> In the Bayar
tribe one of the “methods of bringing about marriage”
is a dance, performed by both sexes, who face each
other in rows and exchange impromptu love couplets.
Similar festivals are also met with among the Bendkars
and Khonds.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> The Hos and Mundaris, on the other
hand, afford an example of sexual selection in its grossest
form at their yearly festivals, during which excited
dionysiac dances and obscene and blasphemous speeches
are connected with wild promiscuous orgies.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>In the improvised ditties that are sung during these
dances Darwin would, of course, have found the most
convincing proofs of the applicability of his theory to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
poetry. Among love-inspired songs few specimens can
be found which are so genuine, and at the same time
so full of delicate feeling, as the harvest antiphonies
sung by the Khyoungtha boys and girls.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> How high an
opinion of the power in poetry to charm is held by these
tribes can be judged from the fact that the Chukmas
never allow any songs but those of a religious character
to be sung in their villages. Our girls would be
demoralised, they say, if boys were allowed to sing
freely. When living in the jungle, however, where the
rules of morality are laxer, the Chukmas allow their
poetry greater license.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>It is needless to say that some kind of erotic poetry
is generally to be found in all the tribes where dancing
expresses love. There have been translated some exquisite
samples of erotic songs composed by the Malay
tribes of Java and Sumatra. In some instances it is
quite evident that these songs have been used as means
of winning the favour of the women. In other cases,
however, it seems safest to draw no conclusions as to
their purpose. At any rate, love occupies an important
place in the poetry which has been collected in Malaysia,
not only among the Malays proper, but also among the
Tagals, Alfuras, Battaks, etc.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>In some of their dancing songs the Australian aboriginal
poets are said to describe the charms of their
sweethearts.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> But we know of no poems in which
they appear to be directly addressed. Neither have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
we found any decisive statement as to the character of
the erotic poetry in Tahiti and New Zealand.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>Purer and more unmistakable examples of singing
used as a means of erotic propitiation can be adduced
from some of the American nations. The Iroquois, for
whom dancing festivals are of great importance in the
intercourse between the sexes, are well aware of the
powers of a serenade when they wish to entice a girl
from her hut to a meeting.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> In old Mexico and Peru,
where erotic poetry had reached a high degree of refinement,
songs and music were undoubtedly used in courtship.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
But with these barbaric but not savage peoples
we have already left primitive man far behind.</p>

<p>It is undeniable that increased knowledge of the
various tribes of mankind may necessitate important
corrections in the above review of erotic art. There
might be collected, for instance, specimens of love-inspired
poetry from the really primitive tribes, such as
the Veddas, the Fuegians, etc. Perhaps also it may be
proved that dancing and singing really serve the purposes
of erotic propitiation to a much greater extent
than travellers hitherto have been able to discover.
But the general conclusions are very unlikely to be
changed by any further researches. It is sufficiently
obvious that the Darwinian æsthetic has its chief
support in the productions of barbaric nations, whose
social conditions have been eminently favourable
for the development of erotic art. This view might
be in danger if we had no knowledge of any artistic
activity in the most primitive tribes. But as a rela<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>tively
developed religious drama, and perhaps even
some traditional mythical songs have been found among
the Fuegians;<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> as the Veddas have at least one dance,
possibly religious, and various magic poems;<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> as the
Bushmen are masters of pictorial art and develop a
great dramatic power in their pantomimic imitations of
animals;<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> as among the Australians the surprisingly
high development of theatrical management and instruction<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
stands in the strongest contrast to their poor
erotic lyric;—in a word, as the religious, superstitious,
and traditional forms of art among the lower savages
have such an unmistakable predominance over those of
erotic propitiation, there is no ethnological support for
the assertion that the beginnings of art were due to the
impulse “to attract by pleasing.”</p>

<p>It may, of course, be argued that the Fuegians, the
Veddas, the Bushmen, and the rest, far from representing
primitive man, are really to be considered as
degenerate types. And it may furthermore be contended
that before marriage customs and other social
institutions had reached those forms which now prevail
among the lower tribes, the promiscuous intercourse
between all males and females during a fixed pairing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
season must have produced an erotic art. Whatever
value such reasoning may have, it at any rate implies
the admission that the art-creating influence of sexual
selection cannot be <i>proved</i> on <i>historical</i> grounds. The
question how primitive society is to be reconstructed
cannot as yet be considered to be finally solved. But
even if the original marriage customs had been such as
Darwin supposes, and even if courtship at this unknown
stage of evolution had been carried on by means of art,<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
the fact that several existing tribes appear to be quite
devoid of poetic and dramatic forms of erotic propitiation
restricts the validity of Darwin’s principle in a
considerable degree.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The attraction of the Darwinian theory is of course
obvious. After having realised the important part
which sexual selection plays in the “artistic” activities
of animals, one is naturally tempted to apply the same
principle to all similar activities in men. The influence
of erotic preferences is a biological datum, and, as such,
a principle of a more universal order, so to speak, than
any one of the social or religious motives.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> However
advantageous it may be to apply this all-embracing
explanation to the whole field of art, a descriptive study
of the facts must needs compel us to pay attention to
the sociological influences which assist or impede the
operation of sexual selection. There is no doubt that
there are some secondary sexual characters and activities
which are developed under all social conditions.
And it is no less certain that both sexes are everywhere
influenced by individual predilections. But these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
predilections cannot, of course, be regarded as factors
of importance in a society where strictly-fixed marriage
customs allow the partners no freedom of choice. They
will, on the other hand, produce special and differentiated
means of attraction where, either from demoralisation,
as in Tahiti, or as the result of institutional polygamy,
as in the Mohammedan countries, or owing to free and
idyllic conditions of life, as among the various tribes of
India, competition for the favour of a male or a female
is unrestricted.</p>

<p>It is impossible, without transgressing the limits
of the present work, to give a complete account of the
influences of society on erotic art. An author who
should be able to embrace in his treatment all stages of
evolution, the latest and most highly developed as well
as the earliest, would undoubtedly contribute an interesting
chapter to art-philosophy if he were to explain in
detail and with examples how, <i>e.g.</i>, lyric poetry has
changed with changed marriage customs. Taking the
art of historic nations, the contrast between the literature
of polygamous Orientals and that of Europeans,
whose notions of love are influenced by marriage institutions
at least officially monogamous, would afford an
opportunity for most suggestive comparisons. And
even within the limits of modern art a comparison
perhaps equally instructive may be made between the
different classes of society with their varying forms of
sexual life. No task could be more interesting than
that of finding out to how great an extent the marvellously
refined and differentiated expressions of romantic
love which characterise some schools of modern poetry
are dependent upon the peculiar forms of sexual life
prevailing among the upper classes. As social factors
of powerful, though never sufficiently recognised in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>fluence,
the veiled polyandry and polygamy which lie
at the bottom of modern society have undoubtedly
influenced æsthetic notions as well as artistic activities.
By causing a division of the sexual impulses these
conditions have facilitated the development of an ideal
and æsthetic love-literature which never would have
appeared, and cannot even be understood, among nations
where this division does not exist. On the other hand,
the same causes have, as it is needless to point out,
produced a literature and an art which, by their deliberate
grossness, stand in the strongest contrast not only to
the romantic utterances of civilised nations, but even to
the more naïve products of primitive tribes.</p>

<p>We cannot in this connection do more than indicate
these general views, the validity of which may be easily
tested by the reader by application to modern art.
Within the boundaries of ethnological art—that is,
between the stages of evolution represented by Tierra
del Fuego on one side and ancient Mexico at the other
end—there can, however, be found sufficient proofs of
the general law which manifests itself more fully in the
richer and more highly differentiated products of modern
art. Love, although fundamentally one and uniform as
a feeling, is in its utterances ever changing with changing
conditions of life. If its ground is biological, its nuances
are always determined by sociological influences. Without
taking into due account all these nuances it is
impossible to assert anything about the influences of
sexual selection on art.</p>

<p>The considerations adduced in this chapter have
led to results which, by their negative character, may
seem to be very unsatisfactory. It was shown first
of all that artistic activities, in so far as they
emphasise the qualities of either sex, must necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
exercise an attractive influence on the opposite sex.
From a psychological point of view we tried to prove
that the various forms of self-decoration, such as are to
be met with among primitive tribes, must have been
eminently effectual as means of such attraction. But
we were, on the other hand, compelled to admit that the
primary origin of dress and ornaments in many cases
could be quite as well explained without any reference
to the relation between the sexes. Thus it became
necessary to examine closely the dramatic and poetic
art for the purpose of ascertaining in which tribes competition
for the favour of the opposite sex can be assumed
as a cause of the art. The ethnological evidence,
as quoted in the works on sexual selection, appeared too
incomplete and inconsistent to admit of any general
conclusions being drawn, and it seemed indispensable to
sift the information as well as to classify the instances.
Instead of one all-explaining principle, which could be
applied in all the various cases, we were confronted by
a multitude of causes and conditions, all of which needed
to be investigated separately and weighed against each
other. A reader who thinks every discussion fruitless
which leads to no dogmatic conclusion might perhaps
object that our re-examination of this much-debated
question has utterly failed in its purposes. We may,
however, be allowed to point out that although our
investigation has not led to any definite estimate of the
importance of sexual preferences for the development of
art, it may perhaps have contributed in some degree to
the elucidation of the connection between art, beauty,
and sex.</p>

<p>We have seen that even in the conditions which are
the most favourable for its influence, sexual selection
can never by itself create any quality of beauty. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
kind of ideal the preferences of either sex are able to
call into existence is sufficiently shown by the hideous
deformations of the body which are to be found among
primitive tribes as well as among the most civilised
nations. Wherever, through favourable conditions of
life and work, beauty, <i>i.e.</i> grace and harmony, is
developed in the human body and its movements, there
these qualities will often be enhanced by the selection
that is exercised by either sex. But this selection can,
of course, be of influence only where the sexes enjoy
freedom of choice. This inquiry thus leads to the
general conclusion, which, we hope, will be confirmed
by the reasoning of all the following chapters, that the
problems of beauty and art can never be separated from
the general problems of social life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have endeavoured to show that sexual selection
has only called forth artistic activities in uncivilised
man when the conditions have been especially favourable.
As a cause of artistic activity, sexual <i>selection</i>
does not operate everywhere. But even where there is
no competition between rivals, sexual <i>emotions</i> may
still find an artistic expression. In short, sexual selection
is <i>a</i> cause of erotic art, but it is not the only cause.
With less freedom of choice for the females, there is, of
course, less need for the males to develop especial
activities for the purpose of erotic propitiation. But
even where the female is thus deprived of the signal
influence which she, through her favouring or rejecting
selection, can exercise on the appearance and the activities
of the race, her instinctive coyness may necessitate
some means of erotic persuasion. This purpose is already
served by the various kinds of caressing movements
which are to be found not only among men, but also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
among many species of animals.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> But it is also probable
that primitive man, in the same way as the birds, may
have resorted to song and dance as a mode of winning
the female’s consent. These activities, which are preliminary
to pairing, cannot, of course, be of the same
importance to evolution as those which aim at securing
preference in the selection of mates. But they may
none the less attain a high degree of development. In
degenerate tribes especially, erotic dancing is no doubt
used as an effectual aphrodisiac.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, however, to seek for biological
advantages in erotic dances, pantomimics, and poems.
The strong emotional tension which accompanies pairing
must of itself give rise to some mode of seeking
relief by sound or movement. These manifestations, on
the other hand, will by association revive the pleasurable
feelings with which they have been connected.
As, moreover, among primitive men sexual exaltation
is one of the strongest—in peaceful tribes even <i>the</i>
strongest—feeling which occurs in their life, any other
rapture will borrow the form of its expression from
this elementary passion. It is well known that even in
civilised nations intense delight tends to express itself
in erotic gestures. In some cases, as, <i>e.g.</i>, that of
abnormal religious exaltation, one might think that
a state of high-strung emotion, by suspending all
intellectual life, does in fact leave a man at the mercy
of overwhelming animal impulses. The exaggerated
devotion of all emotional religions sets at liberty the
<i>bête humaine</i>, which can be kept under control only by
the continuous competition with the higher faculties.
In other instances, such as those when people who have
received some good news feel an inclination to embrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
or kiss each other, it is more natural to assume a
process of association. In either case the psychology
of civilised man enables us to understand why erotic
dances are so generally used by primitive tribes, even
on occasions when they seem least appropriate.</p>

<p>It would be superfluous to undertake an ethnological
review of erotic motives in art. As we have already
remarked in the preceding chapter, there are tribes
which, according to the reports of travellers, not only
are completely devoid of erotic art in the sense of
love-propitiation, but do not even allow love any place
as a subject of art. It seems, however, safest to draw
no conclusions from this deficiency of data. Erotic art,
as everything else connected with sexual life, has too
often been overlooked by ethnological authors. Savage,
W. Ellis, Wyatt Gill, Romilly, and many others, consider
themselves bound by modesty to pass over such
pantomimes as are “too indelicate and obscene to be
mentioned.”<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Even the brothers Sarasin, who otherwise
have aimed at the greatest possible completeness
in their account of the Veddas, candidly say that they
have observed no “Lusttänze,” but also never inquired
about them.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> It would not be surprising, therefore, if
some less discreet traveller should at some future time
describe hitherto unknown erotic dances and songs from,
say, the Bushmen or the Andamanese. And there is
the more reason to anticipate that a closer intimacy with
primitive man may bring to light illustrations of erotic
art, as in many savage tribes sexual matters are hedged in
by taboo, and are especially concealed from white visitors.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand it is very probable that the
erotic element in primitive art has often been overrated.
It seems doubtful whether the expressions “improper”
and “indecent,” as used by the travellers in
descriptions of dances and dramas, are always intended
to signify that the representations in question were of
an erotic nature.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> And even when, for the civilised
spectator, a pantomime appears to be most immoral, this
impression may be due to a misunderstanding of its real
meaning. No doubt, ignorance of the language and the
customs of the various tribes has often occasioned false
interpretations. Mr. Reeves, who warns us against
uncritical belief in travellers’ tales, has been able to
adduce from his own experience a most telling example
of such a mistake. When witnessing a performance of
short dramas, “mekes,” in Samoa, he and his party
felt extremely shocked by the indecent action of one of
the interludes. Afterwards, however, he learned from
the natives that the objectionable pantomime was only
intended to represent the movements of a woman
gathering fishes in a basket.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>In a descriptive account of primitive art it would,
of course, be necessary to reckon with all these inadequacies
of ethnological evidence. The general
results, such as are wanted for a philosophical treatment,
would not be affected by corrections in single
instances. The probability is that in every tribe,
independently of its social state and of its forms of
sexual selection, erotic feelings have always expressed
themselves in some way or other. With varying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
conditions of life these modes of expression have, of
course, acquired greater or less importance for art.
Where war occupies the attention of the tribe to an
exclusive degree, erotic motives can never occupy a
prominent place in art. Where, as is alleged to be the
case among some Australian tribes, notions of decorum
forbid any expression of the feelings of affection and
love, love songs and dances will hardly be publicly
acknowledged in public art.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> On the other hand, an
erotic literature will be prominent in such communities
as that of Tahiti.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> And when, as in Kamschatka,
poems generally are composed by women, it is only
natural that their subjects should be chiefly “love,
hate, grief, and hope.”<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> These facts are all so self-evident
that there is no need to argue upon them.</p>

<p>More interesting than all these sociological agencies
is the influence of prevailing religious and superstitious
notions. As has been already pointed out, sexual taboo
has in many cases checked the development of erotic
poetry and dance as a public art. But perhaps more
frequent than the cases of such prevention are those
where they have been furthered by phallic systems of
religion. This is of course an additional reason for
caution in accusing primitive art of immorality when it
shocks our feelings of modesty.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Thus the indecency
of religious sculptures connected with ancestor-worship
has undoubtedly often a serious and symbolical meaning.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
In some tribes indecent pantomimes, which otherwise
are strictly forbidden, will be performed, evidently for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
some superstitious reason, at funeral ceremonies.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Perhaps,
also, some superstitious notion about sympathetic
magic lies behind the obscene rites and songs which so
often accompany wedding ceremonies. This principle
appears more unmistakable in the dramatic rites which
are performed by many people as means of removing
sterility. Finally, owing to a combination of sympathetic
magic and animistic conceptions of nature,
erotic pantomime has acquired a prominent place
among agricultural rites.</p>

<p>All these manifestations of pictorial and literary art,
which in aim and intention cannot, properly speaking,
be called erotic at all, will be treated of in the following
chapters. In this connection it is only necessary to
mention the naturalistic dramas which in Africa and
Australia are represented at the initiation of boys in manhood.
We need not explain that the performances in
the male camps, by which the youths are introduced to
all the features of men’s life, naturally assume an obscene
character. But it is interesting that the pantomimes,
which, from our standpoint at least, are so revolting,
sometimes seem to be meant to serve the interests of
morality. Mr. Mathews, in his description of the Bora
ceremony among the Kamilaroi, says that this pantomimic
representation was enacted for the purpose of teaching
youths to abstain from homo-sexual vices.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Knowing
the degree of immorality which has been reached by
many savage tribes, one may readily understand that
the old men in the tribe have resorted to these radical
means of dissuading the boys from vice. And one feels
tempted to apply Mr. Mathews’ explanation to similar
rites in other tribes than the Kamilaroi. The initiation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
ceremonies of the Amazulus, for instance, which would
in no case be possible in any but extremely degenerate
nations, might be explained on the same hypothesis.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>It is significant that the Kamilaroi, in vindication of
their obscene art, have hit upon the very same apology
which was adduced in defence of the French literature
of the eighteenth century. But in both cases, among
the primitives as well as in civilised communities, the
supposed beneficial effects of erotic art seem to be very
questionable. Where dances, dramas, and songs speak
only of sensual pleasure, they will soon kill intellectual
inquisitiveness as well as zeal for work. Sir Henry
Johnston, who has more right than any one else to speak
about the populations of Africa, thinks that the sudden
arrest in the intellectual development of African boys
which can generally be noticed at the time of puberty
is a result of the overpowering sexual stimulation to
which they are at that time exposed.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> As the same
cause, <i>i.e.</i> an art and a social life which are full of
erotic suggestions, operates in many savage tribes, it
may perhaps account to some extent for the fact,
recently commented upon by Kidd, that, notwithstanding
the marvellous teachableness of primitive children,
savages always prove inferior to white men after the
attainment of maturity.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> And it gives a reason for the
tendency—fruitless, no doubt, but none the less sincere—which
is to be found among some of the strongest
nations, the ancient Maori, for instance, to repress and
quench by all possible means the development of an
art that aims deliberately at erotic stimulation.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<small>ART AND WORK</small></h2></div>


<p>In our treatment of erotic art we have been led far
away from the connection between art and the maintenance
of species. Whatever the case may be for animals
and those primitive men whose sexual life is restricted
within a short and fixed pairing season, an artificial
stimulation of the erotic feelings is no <i>biological</i> requirement
for the existing tribes of man. Where art has
mainly served this purpose, it has not, as has been
shown, by any means exercised a beneficial influence on
the race. The most typical illustrations in the last
chapter were therefore found in the artistic productions of
degenerate tribes which no doubt would, if brought into
conflict with less licentious neighbours, prove inferior in
the struggle for existence. And all these instances afford
invaluable arguments to those philosophers who consider
art as a checking and weakening factor in progress.</p>

<p>It is hoped, however, that the present chapter will
contribute towards the refutation of such one-sided
views. We intend to adduce instances from various
stages of culture which will bring out the importance
of art as a favouring factor in the struggle for life.</p>

<p>It is evident that a pantomimic imitation of any
activity must, as exercise and stimulation, facilitate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
subsequent real execution of the same activity. Individuals
and nations who have grown familiar in play
with the most important actions in life’s work have thus
acquired an unquestionable advantage in the struggle
for existence. After the publication of Professor
Groos’s great works on animal and human recreations
it is needless to dwell upon this point. This eminent
psychologist has, with regard to the evolutionary value
of sportive representations—or, as he prefers to say,
“præ-presentations”—of life, been led to consider them
as based on inherited instinctive impulses. Instead of
the play-impulse, which only serves to provide an outflow
for the superfluous energy in the organism, he has
thus introduced the conception of an activity which
exercises an important positive influence on life. And,
on the other hand, his consummate researches have
brought out with especial clearness the intimate connection
between play and art. A great many of the instances
he has collected present all the technical qualifications
of a manifestation of dramatic art. As Groos himself
remarks, only the addition of a disinterested æsthetic
attention in the players is needed in order to transform
the instinctive activities into artistic ones. How this
transition has taken place is a question which will undoubtedly
be treated in the great system of art-philosophy
to which the hitherto published works of Professor
Groos constitute the introduction. We have therefore
only to point out how much support these views derive
from the study of primitive art. In the various tribes,
with their differing types of life, there is afforded a
singular opportunity of observing the connection between
play, or art, and the serious occupations of life.
The games of the children, as well as the dances and
pantomimes of the full-grown, almost everywhere cor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>respond
to the prevailing activities in the various
communities. The North American Indians, the Malays,
the Maoris, the tribes of Central Asia, and others, all
furnish instances of the familiar law that the amusements
of warlike nations mainly consists in exercises
which are preliminary to, or reminiscent of, the experiences
of battle. A war dance or a mimic fight is the
traditional type not only of their public entertainments,
but also of their state ceremonial. No example could
be more telling than that of the Dahomey state dances,
which, however they may begin, always seem to end
with an imitation of the greatest social action in the
country—decapitation.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Where the struggle for existence
is a contest with nature and not with fellow-men, a
hunting or fishing pantomime usually takes the place of
these military performances. It is true that such representations
of work often lose their importance in
national art when the conditions of life grow easier.
Mr. Taplin thus contrasts the rich and varied entertainments
of the Polynesians, who without any exertion
obtain their subsistence from their bountiful soil, with
the amusements of the poor Narrinyeri, who even in
their dances and pantomimes have always practised
“those arts which were necessary to get a living.”<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> But
it is significant that even the inhabitants of these
“happy islands” in their dramatic performances introduce
imitations of rowing, fighting, and other kinds of
common work. And at still higher degrees of development,
where the division of labour has given rise to
special trades, all these various crafts will often, as was
the case in Dahomey, in ancient Peru, and in mediæval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
Europe, be a favourite subject for pantomimic representation.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
If such representations have been of no
especial value as exercise, they may nevertheless, by
bringing about an association between work and pleasure,
have made toil and labour less repugnant. The exertions
called forth by the struggle for existence have thus at
all stages of culture, except that of modern industrialism,
been to some extent facilitated by art.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more important in their influences than
the imitation of work in play or drama are the artistic
activities which accompany the actual performance of
work. As these kinds of dance and song have been
somewhat overlooked by Professor Groos, there is reason
to make them the subject of a closer investigation.</p>

<p>When explaining the manifestations of art which
can thus, in the literal meaning of the word, be called
songs and dances of action, we have to divide our attention
between two different points of view. First, the
need of stimulation and regulation of the work of the
individual, and, second, the need of co-operation in the
work of different individuals. In both these respects
art has had an importance among primitive tribes which
can scarcely be overrated.</p>

<p>It is well known that at a lower degree of mental
development the power of instantaneous muscular exertion
is far less than among educated men. Broca’s
experiments showed that artisans with somewhat trained
intelligence generally reached higher figures on a dynamometer
than working men who were only used to
bodily exertions. And the Negroes, whose forces were
tested by Féré, were far below the average of Europeans.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
As in these experiments the natives were introduced to
new and unaccustomed movements, the evidence of
the psychometric apparatus must be considered as
somewhat extenuated by the circumstances. Broadly
speaking, these experiments can, however, be taken as
indications of a general psychological law.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The experimental
evidence is, moreover, corroborated by the
common complaints of Europeans who have had to
rely on natives. The slowness with which the primitive
man gets into swing with his work has no doubt been
referred to times without number by slavekeepers
when advocating their methods of treating natives.
Strange to say, there are some tribes which themselves
candidly admit their own inertness, and voluntarily submit
to whipping in order to get “their blood a little
agitated.”<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>The slowness and the insensibility of the Guarani are,
however, as appears from Mr. Rengger’s description,
exceptional and pathological.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> But it seems as if almost
all tribes had invented some means of inciting themselves
to work. Only, these means are seldom such as
Europeans would feel inclined to avail themselves of
when urging on their workers. That they can nevertheless
be as effectual as even the slavekeepers whip
is shown by Signor Salvado. His description of his
experiences with Australian natives as farm-labourers
is delightful: “How often,” says he, “have I not used
their dancing songs in order to encourage and urge them
on in their work. I have seen them, not once, but a
thousand times lying on the ground with minds and
bodies wearied by their labour; yet as soon as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
heard me singing the Machielò-Machielé, which is one
of their commonest and favourite dancing songs, they
would yield to an irresistible impulse, and rise and join
me with their voices. They would even begin to dance
joyfully and contentedly, especially when they saw me
singing and dancing among them, like any other
savage. After a few minutes of dancing I would seize
the opportunity to cry out to them in a merry voice,
Mingo! Mingo! a word meaning breast, which is also
used in the same way as our word courage. After
such an exhortation they would gradually set to work
again. And they would begin afresh with such goodwill
and eagerness, that it seemed as if the dance of
Machielò had communicated to them new courage and
new vigour.”<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>From many parts of the world there may be quoted
examples of savages who always raise a chant when
compelled to overcome their natural laziness.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> In many
cases they seem, as in Salvado’s anecdote, to avail
themselves of words and melodies which perhaps were
originally intended only for amusement.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> But it is also
well known that working men everywhere stimulate
themselves by special songs of exhortation.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> And when
employed in prolonged and monotonous work they
everywhere seem to know that toil may be relieved by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
song.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> The majority of these work poems may perhaps
be of no great poetical or musical merit, but that
does not affect their great evolutionistic importance.
Whether Noiré is right or not in his theory that language
has developed from the work cries of primitive
men,<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> there is no doubt that some of the simplest and
perhaps earliest specimens of poetry are to be found
among the short ditties sung by labourers during their
work. The stimulus which is provided by such songs
is easily understood without any explanation. But
their invigorating power will be perceived more clearly
when we take into account that emotional susceptibility
to musical impressions which has been remarked in so
many primitive tribes.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Besides these invigorating
effects, every musical accompaniment will also, by
virtue of its rhythmic elements, regulate the movements
of work, and thereby produce a saving of force deployed.</p>

<p>When the words of the work-songs refer to the
action itself, the effect will be strengthened by verbal
suggestion. It is true that many of the songs which
are sung during the manufacture of weapons and
utensils, during boat-building and such-like, are magical
in their intention.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> But there is no doubt that the
ideas of poetical magic are to a great extent derived
from a psychological experience of the suggestive power
of words. Without committing ourselves to any superstition,
we can easily believe that—in Polynesia as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
as in ancient Finland—canoes were better built when
the “boat-building” song was properly recited by the
builder. Only we prefer to think that the magic
operated on the workman and not on his material.</p>

<p>The psychological influence of the work dances is
still easier to understand. Preliminary movements,
even when undirected, always make the subsequent
action more effective; witness a golfer’s flourish before
driving. As Lagrange has pointed out, their effect will
be to develop that amount of animal heat which is
necessary for every muscular contraction.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> When,
moreover, they are fixed and differentiated in their
form, the influence will of course be all the greater.
By every attempt to execute a special movement, the
idea of such movement is made more and more distinct.
And as hereby the ideomotor force of this representation
is increased, the final action must be executed
with greater ease and greater efficacy. The validity
of this law may be easily proved by experimental
psychology. Féré has in his dynamometrical tests
observed that the second pressure always attains a
higher figure than the first one. “La première pression
a pour effet de renforcer la représentation mentale du
mouvement.”<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Without any theoretical knowledge of
these psychological facts, the common man has always
been able to avail himself of the beneficial effects which
are to be derived from preliminary imitations of any
difficult movement. Hence the curious pantomimes of
experimentation which we may always observe in the
artisan who has to give a finishing touch to his work, or
in the athlete who tries to perform a new and unaccustomed
exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>The psychology of movement-perception, as we have
described it in the foregoing, makes it evident that a
similar prompting influence may be exercised by the
actions of others.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> This is an experience which must
have occurred, we should imagine, to every one who
has been coached in golf by a professional. When
concentrating his attention upon each successive
movement in the instructor’s model performance, the
beginner in sports and gymnastics receives with his
whole body, so to speak, an impression of the exercise
he has to go through. The representation thus gains
in distinctness as well as in motor force, and the subsequent
movement is executed in an almost automatic
way.</p>

<p>These familiar facts from the psychology of everyday
life will explain why among the savage tribes we
so often meet with the institution of the præsul. When
any labour is to be performed which requires the co-operation
of many hands, such as the harvest or rowing,
the præsul demonstrates in dance or pantomime
the sequence of movements which the others have to
go through.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> By the suggestive influence of his
performance all the individual workers are stimulated
in their exertions. More important, however, than this
stimulation is the co-ordination of labour which is
effected by the element of rhythm in song and
dance.</p>

<p>We have in a previous chapter spoken at sufficient
length of the incalculable æsthetic importance of rhythm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
as a means of producing emotional community between
different individuals. In this connection we have still
to point out that a fixed time-division must in the same
way facilitate common activity. From the historical
point of view this practical aspect is undoubtedly the
more important. However fundamental and primordial
the æsthetic function of the perception of rhythm may
seem for the theorist, it is most probable that the
development of this faculty has been chiefly furthered
by its utilitarian advantages. There is no doubt that
even the most primitive man may feel the want of
associating his fellow-men in his emotions, and that for
this purpose he may be able to give the expression of
them a fixed rhythmical form. But the power of perceiving
this time-division as a rhythm, and of obeying it
closely in song and dance, would, as Dr. Wallaschek
has shown, certainly not have attained so high a degree
of development if this power had not, by facilitating
common activity, been of such immense advantage for
the maintenance of species.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> It goes without saying
that any work which necessitates the co-operation of
several workers must be executed with greater efficiency
the more closely the individuals follow to a common
rhythm.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, therefore, that, as Spencer
remarks, the incompetence of the Arab and Nubian
boatmen on the Nile is chiefly a result of their inability
to act together. As an Arab dragoman is
reported to have said, a few Europeans would, by virtue
only of their superior powers of co-operation, do in a
few minutes what now occupies hundreds of men.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
Such an incapacity for concerted action is, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
quite exceptional among the lower tribes of men. Some
tribes, as <i>e.g.</i> the farmer Negroes in West Africa and the
Malay and Polynesian boatmen, are even famous for the
wonderful regularity of their work.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> This regularity, on
the other hand, has been explained by all travellers as a
result of the rhythmical songs by which their work is
accompanied.</p>

<p>It is significant that the most typical specimens of
working songs and dances should be met with in the
tribes of Oceania. The insular life, which even in other
respects has been so favourable to the development of
art, has necessitated a most intimate co-operation
between individuals.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Hence the development of canoe
dances and boating songs, by help of which the movements
of the rowers are adjusted according to common
and fixed rhythms.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The same necessity has of course
produced similar results, in a greater or less degree, in
every community where the type of life makes collective
action needful. It has not given rise to any important
manifestations of art among the pastoral tribes, in which
individuals can do well enough without help from each
other. In agricultural societies, on the other hand, it
has called forth those sowing and harvest dances or
songs which are so familiar in the folklore of the
civilised nations.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> And, more than any other of life’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
occupations, war has required an active coherence
between the individual members of the tribe. The
influence of military institutions on art is, however, in
more than one respect so important that its treatment
must be reserved for a special chapter.</p>

<small>ART AND WAR</small></h2></div>


<p>In the <cite>Principles of Sociology</cite> Mr. Spencer has
devoted some of his most forcible paragraphs to a treatment
of the social influences of war. By adducing and
comparing with each other types of social life among
different tribes, he has been able to show how military
customs everywhere tend to reduce the individual liberty
and strengthen the central power.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Many other writers
on sociology have perceived and commented on the
truism that the internal coherence of tribes has been
chiefly produced by the need of combination for
defensive purposes.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> But perhaps sufficient attention
has not been paid to the share which art has had in the
development of those peculiarities which are common to
all military nations. And yet as a means of facilitating
tribal unity of action and feeling, music and dance must
be of exceptional sociological importance in warlike
communities.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>We shall therefore meet with highly developed choral
dances in those nations in whose life war is a customary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
occurrence. The North American Indians,<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> as well as
the Dahomeyans,<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> are noted for the soldier-like regularity
of their dances. But nowhere among the lower tribes
of mankind is the time-sense so refined as among the
pre-eminently warlike Maori. Notwithstanding the
furious movements in their war dances, the gesticulation
of all the participants is always uniform and regular.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
According to Cruise the very slightest motions of their
fingers are simultaneous;<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> and, if we are to believe Mr.
Bidwill, even their eyes all move together.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Highly
accomplished dancers as are certain other Polynesian
tribes<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> less warlike than the Maori, it will be admitted
that such a pitch of more than Prussian precision would
never have been attained if it were not for its military
advantages. To the same cause one is also tempted to
ascribe the regularity of the Kaffir dances,<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> which by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
their choral character stand in so marked a contrast to
the amusements of the neighbour tribe, the peaceful
Hottentots, among whom every dancer acts “separately
for himself.”<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that a regular co-operation in fighting
is effectually promoted by rhythmical music. And we
do in fact find that music, especially instrumental music,
at the lower stages of development is closely connected
with war.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> It is, however, more natural to assume that
military music, and similarly military poetry and dance,
have had their chief importance not as regulating but
as stimulating influences. There are many tribes which
seem quite unable to observe any kind of military
discipline. But even in the undeveloped and unmethodical
warfare of the lowest savages, music, songs,
and dances have been used as means of infusing courage
and strength. The psychology of these military stimuli
is of course the same as that of industrial art. But the
general principles appear with far greater clearness when
applied to this peculiar kind of activity.</p>

<p>First of all, the need of stimulation is never so great
as when a man has to risk his life in an open battle.
If in work he has to overcome his natural inertia,
laziness, he has here to overcome the still stronger
obstacle of fear. Contrary to the romantic notions of
popular literature, primitive man seems to be timorous
rather than brave when not encouraged by adventitious
excitement.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> This cowardice can, however, to a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
extent be explained by defective military organisation.
Where the mutual support which the well-drilled soldiers
of a regular army render each other is lacking, the need
of personal courage is of course so much the greater.
Civilised warfare tries to avoid the conflict between the
instinct of self-preservation and of a soldier’s duty by
the pressure of strict discipline; savage warfare, which
cannot count on the same forces of submission and
mental control, is compelled to minimise this conflict by
deadening the consciousness of peril. Hence the indispensability
of some means of producing violent excitement
by which the necessary forgetfulness of danger
and death may be attained.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>Apart from the influence of fear, the task of slaughter
is one which, from its very nature, cannot be performed
in cold blood. Even where the element of danger is
absent, as when unarmed foes are killed or tortured,
the savage executioners do not generally get to work
straight away. As soon as a beginning has been made,
a sort of intoxication will indeed be produced by mental
as well as physical agencies, such as the sight of blood
or the pride of conquest. But this intoxication, so
eagerly desired by savages in civilised as well as in
primitive communities, cannot be produced even in the
lowest tribes of man without a preliminary working up.
The passion of cruelty, like that of love, is, in its higher
and more ecstatic forms, too overwhelming in its mental
effects to be attained without an artificial enhancement
of psychical capacity. But whereas the erotic feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
tend with growing development to become more and
more a private matter, cruelty is among warlike tribes
an emotion of national importance. The incitement to
slaughter is therefore apt to become social—that is,
common to several individuals at once. This is one of
the reasons why war is of so much greater importance
than love as a motive for tribal art.</p>

<p>There are some tribes in which the soldiers try to
acquire courage and thirst for blood by magical expedients,
such as smearing themselves with some
powerful unguent, or eating the raw meat of a newly
slaughtered ox.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Sometimes a joint tattooing of the
whole corps with a common pattern is undertaken, most
probably for the same magical purpose.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> But however
effectually such ceremonies may be supposed to operate,
savages do not generally put so much trust in them as
to give up their favourite means of stimulation—music
and dancing. In people who sincerely believe in their
own magic any rite will of course arouse increased confidence
and courage. But this suggestive influence is
only indirect in comparison with the immediate psychological
effects of inciting dances.</p>

<p>Popular novels have familiarised us all with the
weird war dances which play such an important part in
the warfare of the North American Indians. In its
main features this type of pantomimic incitement is
the same everywhere—among the African and Oceanic
tribes as well as among the savage nations described in
classic literature.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> By imitating the movements of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
real fight, by exulting cries, deafening noise, and
brandishing of weapons, the dancers work themselves
up to a pitch of frenzy which cannot be compared to
anything but a transient madness. Especially among
the nations of America war dances often arouse so much
excitement, even when performed during times of
perfect peace, that they become dangerous to friendly
and peaceful onlookers.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Here also—just as in the
Hungarian “Enlistment”—dancing is used as a means
of enticing men to join the ranks of the war chief who
wants recruits for some war-expedition.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that the influence of such pantomimes
is not restricted to a generalised stimulation and
encouragement. These sham fights, just as the sportive
imitations of work, must facilitate the execution of those
movements which they imitate. And even those who
do not join the dance will profit by watching the
evolutions which they themselves will afterwards be
called on to perform in reality. Thus there may
originally have been a very utilitarian reason for the
curious warfare of the Headhunters of Ceram, who
always have the Jakalele dance performed in front of
their fighting line. It is pathetic to read that even in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
their wars with the Dutchmen a few fantastically dressed
dancers head the advance against the repeating guns of
the European force.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>This fact, which is certainly not without its parallels
in other savage tribes, gives the most convincing proof
of the indispensability of pantomimic stimulation to
savage warfare. Although less intimately connected
with fighting itself, poetry has had for war an importance
which can scarcely be estimated at a much lower
rate. Words, of course, can never provoke such a direct
and almost physiological stimulation as the imitation of
actions. But words, on the other hand, have a greater
effect on the mind. The suggestive power of the war
songs is also attested by the descriptions of travellers
among various tribes. In Australia, for instance, four
or five mischievously inclined old women can soon stir
up forty or fifty men to any deed of blood by means of
their chants, which are accompanied by tears and groans,
until the men are worked into a perfect state of frenzy.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
“The savage blood of the Ahts always boiled when the
war songs were recited, their fingers worked convulsively
on the paddles, and their eyes gleamed ferociously;
altogether they were two hundred murderous-looking
villains.”<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> In Ashanti and in New Zealand—in short,
amongst all the most warlike tribes—the military singers
are able to bring themselves and their audience up to
a pitch of frenzy which is almost equal to that produced
by the dances.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>In one of the preceding chapters we have already
pointed out how invaluable a support historic art has
given to national pride. This feeling, on the other hand,
is never so indispensable as in time of war. Wherever
a tribe has any traditions of its past history, such traditions
are always revived and recited to the soldiers
before and during the battles.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> And if a people has no
glorious ancestors to boast of, it can none the less gain
the necessary confidence by glorifying its own valour
and reviling its enemies. Even tribes like the Bakairis,
for example, are thus able to “sing themselves full of
courage” in boasting and defiant exultation.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>According to competent observers, such songs are
more particularly employed when the natives are afraid.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
The expression of bravery, even if originally affected,
must necessarily awaken some real feeling of pride or
confidence. Contempt, on the other hand, however
laboriously worked up, is the most effectual means of
preserving equanimity under the stress of depressing
feelings, admiration, envy, or fear. Songs and pantomimes,
such as, for instance, those with which the
Polynesians invariably begin their battles, must therefore
have a great power of emboldening the warriors.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> And
while such outward shows of valour enable the performers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
to reconquer their courage, the enemy is intimidated by
these manifestations of a feeling which is as yet incipient
within themselves. In warfare, where the hostile armies
stand within sight and hearing of each other, this consideration
must of course be of extreme importance.</p>

<p>It seems, indeed, as if natural selection had developed
in man an almost instinctive tendency to overcome fear
by simulating the expressions proper to valour and
menace. Just as animals, when frightened, make
themselves bigger and more formidable to their enemies,
whether from fear or anger we know not, so man tries
to awaken fear in the enemy confronting him at the
same time, and by the same means, as he vanquishes
his own fear. This appears with especial clearness in
wars between savage races, where both sides often seem
to be as timid as they try to appear formidable and
courageous. Their threats and boastings are terrifying
enough, but the real fights are very bloodless and free
from danger. Among the Cammas “the words really
seem to do more damage than the blows.”<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> The gallant
game of bluff is in primitive politics not restricted to
diplomatic negotiations; it plays an important part in
the actual fighting. This remains true even with regard
to tribes which are capable of real courage, not only in
stealthy assault, but also in open battle. The Maorian
military pantomimes afford the best example of such a
manifestation, which not only stimulates the warriors to
fight and regulates their movements in the battle, but
also, as a European traveller has been compelled to
admit, “strikes terror into the heart of any man.”<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
this case the terrible effect is further strengthened by
the hideous grimaces, rolling of the eyes, protruding of
the tongue, and so on, with which the warriors
accompany their dance.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> So important is this distortion
of the countenance considered by the Maoris, that
instruction in the art of grimacing forms a part in their
military education.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> The most warlike of savage tribes
thus does not despise the naïve expedient which constitutes
almost the sole means of self-defence among
peaceful Eskimos.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> And so highly do the Maoris
appreciate the terrifying effects of the protruded tongue,
that they carve the grimace upon their spears, the
“hanis,” evidently in the belief that such representations
will—perhaps by some magic power—demoralise
the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>This pictorial pantomime brings us to the employment
of formative arts in war. To some extent even
painting, especially in its decorative branches, may be
considered as a means of exhortation. The various
decorations of the body which are usually adopted for
fighting no doubt raise the courage of their wearers.
A festival dress, when assumed for battle—for example,
by the Khonds—must needs bring with it a light and
festive mood.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> The red colour, so often used in
military dress, tends, on the other hand, to arouse increased
vigour by direct physiological as well as by
associative action.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> Perhaps also, as some old authors
suggest, the use of red may have had a negative im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>portance
by concealing the wounds and the blood,
which else might depress the men and encourage their
enemies.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Like every beautiful thing, highly ornamented
weapons will afford their owners an invigorating
feeling of pride, which, however,—to judge from the
unheroic character of many tribes whose weapons are
most gorgeously decorated,—does not seem to be of any
great military advantage.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Military ensigns, such as banners, standards, and
the like, will naturally, as outward symbols of the tribe,
exercise an exciting influence on the warriors. Even
for barbarous nations, with their undeveloped feelings
of patriotism, in the modern sense of the word, a flag
may represent <i lang="fr">la patrie en marche</i>. Well knowing
the moral value of these apparently unimportant
things, the Aztecs employed in their army men whose
only task was “to remove from the eyes of the enemy
every object that could heighten their courage and
inflame their pride.”<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>The importance of field badges is of course increased
when, as generally is the case, they are adorned with
some religious or magical representation. Be it a
tutelar saint, a heathen god, or simply a totem animal,
which is depicted, these images will always be relied
upon as a strong support to the army.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> The marvellous
tales of assistance afforded by idols which have been
carried in the front of battle may of course have some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
real foundation in the encouraging mental effects produced
upon the warriors.</p>

<p>It thus appears that ornaments, painting, and sculpture
have been of no small influence in enhancing the
fighting powers of warlike nations. Among the lower
tribes of man these arts are, however, on the whole
much more appreciated as means of frightening the
enemy. As was mentioned in a preceding chapter,
some bodily deformations are, if we may believe the
natives, undertaken solely for this purpose.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Other
warlike tribes endeavour to make themselves dreaded
by their enemies by staining their bodies with ghastly
colours, blood-red, azure, or black. Tattooing may, of
course, often aim at the same end. And among the
detached ornaments there is an especial class—for
which the German ethnologists have invented the
characteristic designation “Schreckschmuck”—which
are only worn in order to make the appearance more
frightful. The war helmets of the Thlinkeets<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> and the
curious tooth masks of the Papuas are the most
typical specimens of this pre-eminently warlike decoration.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>The highest development of art as a means of terrifying
is, however, to be found in the decorated shields
of the Dyaks. No form of pictorial threat could be
more effectual than the devices which ornament the
face of these ghastly weapons. A grinning mouth, with
sharp tusks in either jaw, is always to be found in the
middle of the shield. Above it stand a pair of staring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
circular eyes, usually surrounded by dark and light concentric
rings. Sometimes also there is a highly simplified
outline of the lower parts of the body. The trunk
is completely ignored, and arms and legs are quite
swamped in a bewilderment of entangled lines, which
extend over the whole surface of the shield. But in this
ornamentation the warlike motive is repeated over and
over again. Tusks protrude from the scrolls, and big
round eyes stare menacingly out between them. Thus
even the decorative “padding” (Einfüllung) operates as
a multiplied expression of defiant menace. As an
eloquent commentary on this text the whole shield is
furthermore hung with tufts of human hair,—trophies
of vanquished enemies,—which partly conceal the brown,
red, and black design.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> The whole composition, which
in a description may seem merely bizarre and brutal,
is, however, executed with a severe symmetry and a wild
grace which afford a most peculiar contrast to the weird
motive. By these æsthetic qualities the ornamentation
acquires an art-value which is quite independent of its
supposed military advantages. One can indeed easily
understand that the savage foes of the Dyaks may be
paralysed with terror when confronted in battle with
those glaring eyes and menacing jaws. But even the
civilised observer who examines at his ease the shields
which stand in the glass cases of ethnological collections
must needs be impressed by their power. Though
they do not frighten us, they are not, as might be expected,
mere examples of ridiculous grimace. They
still extort our admiration for that weird kind of beauty
which, in primitive art as well as in animal warning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span> colorationn,
is so often found in close connection with
the feelings of terror.</p>

<p>We have deemed it profitable to dwell at some
length on these remarkable products of savage decorative
art. The demon shields of the Dyaks, in spite
of the fact that their motives have evidently been
borrowed from Chinese and Indian art,<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> are eminently
representative of the nation and its social <i>milieu</i>.
These wild men of the woods have been able to express
in their ornamental composition, better than would
have been possible in any higher form of art, all the
intense feelings of their wild romantic life. The terror
and intoxication of slaughter, as they are experienced in
a tribe for which furtive murder is the holiest of all
religious actions, speak their violent language in the
glaring patterns. But at the same time the elegant design,
which is so characteristic a peculiarity of the shields, as
well as of every other specimen of Dyak art, corresponds
to the graceful and elegant personal appearance which,
according to the unanimous verdict of all travellers,
distinguishes these fierce savages.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> And it seems as if
this gracefulness, no less than the weird emotional
content of the pictures, may be derived from the custom
of head-hunting. The continuous insecurity which has
given its own character even to the Dyak architecture<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> has
of course not been without its influence on the physical
development of the tribe itself. Where assault from
insidious enemies is always to be expected, and where
the type of fighting is single combat, lightness and
suppleness of movement must be indispensable for the
struggle for existence. We can, therefore, easily under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>stand
how these people have acquired that natural
grace which similar utilitarian causes have developed
among all mountainous animals, and among most beasts
of prey.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Nor is it difficult to comprehend that this
beauty of the human body, once called into existence
by natural selection, must have awakened æsthetic attention
to form and grace, and thus indirectly influenced
even the manifestations of ornamental art.</p>

<p>If it be objected that such sociological explanations
of decorative patterns are too far-fetched, we at once
refer to the marvellous Maori ornaments, in which the
temperament of another warlike tribe has found a most
characteristic expression. Like the fantastic convolutions
on the Dyak shields, the flaming scrolls of black and
red which extend over the ceilings and walls of the
Maori houses unmistakably attest their origin from a
nation which war has made violent, vigorous, and intensely
energetic.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Generally speaking, it may be futile
to seek for any differentiated expressional qualities in
such an impersonal and unemotional art as that of
linear ornament. But in face of these powerful designs
even the most neutral observer will be struck with the
strong emotional exaltation which has here found a vent,
not in words, or sounds, or images, but in pure lines
and colours. Such mighty strokes, so full of life and
agitation, could never have been drawn by any peaceful
and quiet natives. The velocity and the wild inspiration
of these patterns are only possible in a nation
which has experienced in continuous fights an ever-repeated
state of high-strung emotional excitement.</p>

<p>The more official Maori decorative art, the Moko, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
well as the Maori sculpture, probably because of their close
connection with religion, are too rigid in their traditional
character to admit of any strongly pronounced emotional
content. But the influence of warlike exaltation has
instead made itself felt in the poetical productions of
the race. And, as has already been pointed out, but
for the military type of life dancing could not have
reached so marvellous a degree of development. Owing
to the more organised character of Maori warfare, military
customs do not, as among the Dyaks, aim chiefly
at producing suppleness and graceful movements in the
individual. But one has only to read the enthusiastic
descriptions of the painter Earle in order to realise
the influence which military customs have even here
exercised on the development of plastic beauty.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>The Dyaks and Maoris are but two of the most
typical among savage tribes whose artistic productions
have grown up under the auspices of war. For a complete
account of art in its connection with war it would be
necessary to dwell on the war songs of the North American
Indians,<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> to give some account of the art-style which is
found in the military despotisms of Western Africa,<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> and
to describe in detail the poetry which has been called
into existence by the continuous tribal feuds of the
North African nomadic hordes.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> In its broad aspects,
however, the æsthetic importance of war will, we hope,
appear with sufficient clearness from the cursory review
which has been given above.</p>

<p>We have seen that war, as the hardest form of the
struggle for life, has needed, more than any other kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
of work, the support which æsthetic stimulation affords
to practical activities. And the art which has developed
under its influence has, to a greater degree than is
usual in primitive production, fulfilled the conditions of
emotional community and emotional intensity. Moreover,
the requirements of fighting have called forth
æsthetic qualities of power and gracefulness in the
physical type which seem to be reflected even in artistic
creation. Thus the art-production of military tribes
has everywhere, independently of racial and climatic influences,
acquired some common qualities; their decorative
arts, as well as their poetry and dramatic dances,
are always characterised by an intense and forcible life,
which is often combined with dignified power and
graceful elegance.</p>

<p>All these are, of course, only restricted merits, which
correspond to some striking deficiencies. It is easily
understood that art-life in a military state of society
always tends to be circumscribed within the narrow
boundaries of tribal sympathy. It may also be pointed
out, at least as a curious and significant coincidence,
that descriptive and figurative art, in the sense of
realistic, faithful rendering of nature and life, has never
attained any high development among the most military
tribes. Such a sympathetic interest in the picturesque
qualities of the human and animal body as that which
characterises the art of the prehistoric European cave-dwellers,
the Bushmen, and the Eskimo, does not seem
compatible with the customs of war. In this connection it
is not our business to estimate critically the comparative
importance of these merits and deficiencies: we have
only to point out the undeniable significance which,
from an historical point of view, must be accorded to
war as a factor in the development of art.</p>

<small>ART AND MAGIC</small></h2></div>


<p>Sympathetic magic has in recent times become a
favourite subject of scientific study. We may therefore
proceed to trace the influence which this important
factor has exercised on the development of art-forms
without going through the labour of presenting and
describing the evidence of its occurrence at the different
stages of evolution. It is sufficient to refer to the
copious and detailed researches of Hartland, Frazer,
Béranger-Féraud, and others. What we need is only a
psychological interpretation of all the facts which have
been brought together by these authors.</p>

<p>The instances of sympathetic magic are naturally
divided into two main classes, which, broadly speaking,
correspond to the two types of association. But just as
in psychology it is often difficult to decide whether a
given associative process has its origin in a relation of
contiguity or in one of similarity, so it is often an open
question to which group a given superstition is to be
assigned. It may even be possible to deduce both
groups from one common and fundamental magical
principle.</p>

<p>However the definitive theoretical explanation may
turn out, we have for the present to uphold a distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
between the two forms. And in order to start from the
facts that are simpler and easier to explain, we shall
first devote our attention to <i>sympathetic magic based on
a material connection between things</i>.</p>

<p>The superstitious notions which can be brought
together under this heading are familiar to every one.
There is scarcely a single book on ethnology or folklore
which does not present some illustrations of the belief
that by acting upon a part of a given whole we may
influence this whole as well as all its other parts. This
universal doctrine of a solidarity between the things
that have entered as parts in the same material totality
has given rise all over the world to beliefs and practices
which, although varying in details, are essentially similar
in general character. We need only refer to the well-known
folk-beliefs as to the necessity of caution in disposing
of clippings of hair or nails, of saliva, or anything
else removed from the human body. Such objects, it is
supposed, would give any enemy into whose hands they
might fall the power of injuring through them the
person from whom they had proceeded.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Almost
equally universal is the belief that close relatives, as
being ingredients in—or perhaps rather partakers of—the
same whole, the family, are bound together in a
quite material solidarity of suffering. From the sociological
point of view this group of superstitions, owing
to the social importance of the last-mentioned totality,
is of especial interest; and therefore the curious customs
concerning the relation between a father and his unborn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
child, between husband and wife, ancestors and descendants,
etc., which no doubt are all based on the idea
of a material connection, have been treated of with
due completeness in sociological literature.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Equally
valuable for the psychological interpretation, although
less pregnant with social import, are all the petty tricks
of sorcery in connection with hunting, fishing, agriculture,
and so on, which are practised even now among
most European nations.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> From the array of facts inserted
by Mr. Hartland in his monumental commentary
on the <cite>Legend of Perseus</cite>, we can form an opinion
of the wide and deep-going influences which the belief
in magical connection between things materially connected
has exercised in all departments of life. And
besides this ethnological apparatus, Mr. Hartland gives
us in this work a most complete and definite account
of the world-view which lies behind all these superstitious
beliefs and practices.</p>

<p>More light, however, is thrown on the philosophy
of this superstition by the researches of M. Rochas
d’Aiglun than by any work on scientific ethnology
and folklore. This is not said in order to detract in
any way from the merits of Messrs. Hartland and
Frazer. But although nothing could surpass the erudition
of these scholars, they could not, in point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
sympathetic and intelligent representation, stand on a
level with an author who himself believes in the reality
of his facts. For those, therefore, who wish to understand
the motives, conscious or unconscious, by which
the adepts of sympathetic magic justify their practices,
nothing could be more instructive than a perusal of
<cite>L’extériorisation de la motricité</cite> and <cite>L’extériorisation
de la sensibilité</cite>. In these works M. Rochas has not
only minutely summarised the seventeenth century
theories and observations of Digby and Papin:<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> he
has also supplemented these old “facts” with his own
experiments on objects that have been saturated with
sensibility and motor power by contact with living
bodies. The power of relics, love philtres, and charms
is thus explained in a way which, however fantastic, is
nevertheless undeniably consistent and methodical.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> A
savage or an uneducated man would indeed be unable to
put his case in the logical form which M. Rochas gives
it. But if he understood scientific terminology, he
would doubtless ratify, as a true interpretation of his
own vague conceptions, the theory of sensitive and motor
effluvia which emanate from all living beings, and link
them to all objects to which they may pass. As a <i>bona
fide</i> statement of magic principles in the language of
modern psychology and modern physics, M. Rochas’
works bring the old superstitions home to us with
unsurpassable force. We learn here to appreciate the
powerful influence which may in all times be exercised
by the underlying belief in an invisible magical chain
connecting things which appear to be severed. When
we see a man of modern civilisation falling back upon
these crude notions, which appeared for a long time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
be quite forgotten, we must needs be convinced that the
world-view of magic, however erroneous, is, so to speak,
a constitutional fallacy of the human mind. In every
department of human ethos, therefore, there is reason
to look for the possible effects of these conceptions.</p>

<p>For the present, however, we have to admit that
sympathetic magic in its simplest form seems to be
without any influence on the origin of works of art.
It is very different with the second kind of magic—namely,
that where the occult influence is based upon <i>a
likeness between things</i>.</p>

<p>To judge from the literature of ethnology and folklore,
this principle seems to be almost as universal as
that of magic by virtue of material connection. Its
influence can be traced in beliefs and practices, not only
of the lowest savages, but also of civilised nations. It
has received elaborate theoretical justification in the old
systems of Greek philosophy, in the theories of Agrippa
and Paracelsus, and in the tenets of modern homœopaths.
And there are even some real facts, such as the beneficial
effects of inoculation and the “katharsis” action of poetry—the
curing of sorrow by tragedy—which are sometimes
quoted in support of the thesis that “like affects
like.”<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Apart from all regard to such spurious arguments
the theory of this form of magic is scarcely less
irrational than that underlying the first group of facts.
From our point of view, however, even the crudest
forms of “homœopathic” magic are of far greater
interest than the examples of sorcery by means of
material connection. Whereas the adepts of the latter
need only procure a nail, a tuft of hair, or a few articles
of clothing belonging to the man they wish to bewitch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
the sorcerer who works by similarities is compelled to
create a representation of things and beings in order to
acquire an influence over them. Thus magical purposes
call forth imitations of nature and life which, although
essentially non-æsthetic in their intention, may nevertheless
be of importance for the historical evolution of
art.</p>

<p>To how great an extent works of art derive their
material from old magical practices, the real meaning
of which has gradually fallen into oblivion, may be
shown in all the various departments of art. There
is not a single form of imitation which has not been
more or less influenced by this principle. Pantomimic
representation, which for us is of value only in virtue
of its intellectual or emotional expressiveness, was in
lower stages of culture used as a magical expedient.
Even a single gesture may, according to primitive
notions, bring about effects corresponding to its import,<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>
and a complete drama is sincerely believed to cause the
actual occurrence of the action which it represents.
Students of folklore know that there is practically no
limits to the effects which primitive man claims to
produce by magical imitation. He draws the rain
from heaven by representing in dance and drama the
appropriate meteorological phenomena.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> He regulates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
the movements of the sun and encourages it in the
labour of its wanderings by his dramatic sun-rituals;<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
and he may even influence the change of the seasons by
dramas in which he drives winter away and brings
summer in.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> By those phallic rites to which we have
already referred in the chapter on erotic art, he tries
in the same way to act upon the great biological
phenomena of human life.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> And again, when sickness
is to be cured, he tries to subdue the demons of disease—to
neutralise their action or to entice them out of
the body of the patient—by imitating in pantomime
the symptoms of the particular complaint.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Finally,
when the assistance of a divine power is required, the
god himself may be conjured to take his abode in the
body of the performer, who imitates what is believed to
be his appearance, movements, and behaviour.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Thus
the belief in the effectual power of imitation has all over
the world given rise to common dramatic motives as
universal as the belief itself, and uniform as the chief
requirements of mankind.</p>

<p>There are, no doubt, many instances of dramatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
ritual the purpose of which is as yet a matter of
discussion. With regard to some of the symbolic
dances representing hunting or fishing or the movements
of game-animals, much may be said in favour of
Mr. Farrer’s view that the object of the pantomime is
to make clearer to the deity a prayer regarding the
things imitated.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Similarly it is open to doubt whether
the dramatic performances at initiation ceremonies, such
as, for instance, the kangaroo dance described by Collins,
are meant to impart instruction concerning the customs
of the animals to the novitiates, or to confer upon them
a magic power over the game.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> In the therapeutic
practices of primitive tribes we may find still more
puzzling points of controversy. The sucking cure, for
instance, by which the medicine-man pretends to extract
from the patient the cause of his illness in the form of
some small object—a pebble, a tuft of hair, or the like—may
be, as Professor Tylor thinks, a mere “knavish
trick.”<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> But it is also possible, we believe, that, at least
originally, it may have been performed as a <i>bona fide</i>
magic, based upon the notion of the efficacy of vehicles
and symbolic action. The method of restoring sick people
and sick cattle to health by pulling them through a
narrow opening, for instance, in a tree, which has been
explained by most authors as a case of magical trans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>ference
by contact—<i>i.e.</i> transference of the disease from
the patient and of the vital power represented by the
tree to him<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>—ought, according to the brilliant hypothesis
of Professor Nyrop, to be considered as a magically
symbolic representation of regeneration.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>While leaving undecided all these subtle questions,
each of which would require a chapter of its own in
order to be definitively treated, we have only to maintain
the great probability which stands on the side of the
dramatic interpretation. However fantastic the belief
in a magical connection between similar things may
appear at the outset, a continued ethnological study
must needs convince every one of its incalculable
importance in the life of primitive man. And such a
conviction can only become confirmed by an examination
of the influence which this superstition has
exercised on the formative arts.</p>

<p>The belief in picture magic is evinced by its negative
as well as by its positive results. All over the world we
meet with the fear of being depicted. In so far as this
superstition has given rise to a prohibition of painting
and sculpture, it has thus seriously arrested the development
of art. But, on the other hand, the same notion has
commonly called forth pictorial representation, the aim of
which is to gain a power over the things and beings represented.
Most frequent, perhaps, of all these specimens
of magical art are the volts, <i>i.e.</i> those dolls and drawings
used for bewitching, which are spoken of as early as in
the ancient Chaldean incantations, which are used by
the majority of savage tribes, and which may incidentally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
be found even now among the European nations.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> But
owing to their necessarily clandestine character these
charms have never exercised any important influence on
the pictorial art. More important, from the historical
point of view, than these black and cryptic arts is the
white magic by which social benefits are pursued. Just
as the principal forms of magical drama correspond to the
chief requirements of mankind, so the most important
magical sculptures and paintings are found in connection
with agricultural rites,<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> the observances of hunting
and fishing,<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> medical practices,<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> and ceremonies for
removing sterility.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> And in the same way as dramatic
representation, but with far greater efficacy, pictorial
representation has been able to satisfy the highest
material as well as spiritual requirement by bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
the deity in concrete relation with man through the
sympathetic force of the image. The art of conjuring
a spirit to take its abode in what is believed to be a
counterfeit of its corresponding body has thus given
rise to the fashioning of idols and the subsequent adoring
of them. Although essentially the same as in the
simple medical cures and the practices of sorcery,
pictorial magic has in these cases of idol-making
exercised a more far-reaching and thorough influence
on mankind than in any of its other manifestations.</p>

<p>We need not dwell at any length on the superstitions
connected with poetic or literary descriptions of
things. The universal objection to the mentioning of
proper names is evidently based upon a belief in the
efficacy of words. And, on the other hand, this same
belief lies behind the equally universal use of incantations.
Songs that are sung in order to facilitate the
labour of workers and to increase the result of it, poems
that aim at conjuring the favour of a hard-hearted or
indifferent woman, charms for invoking or expelling
spirits, and medical spells,—all these forms of poetic
magic are too familiar to be more than mentioned.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the civilised observer the
above-quoted examples of dramatic, pictorial, and poetic
magic may seem to have an obvious and ready explanation.
A work of art always gives to the spectator, and
no doubt also to the creator, an illusion of reality. As,
moreover, primitive man is notoriously unable to distinguish
between subjective and objective reality, it
seems natural to assume that it is the mental illusion
created by his work which makes the magician believe
that he has acquired a power over the things represented
by it. And this assumption is all the more tempting
because even to civilised, enlightened man there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
something magical in the momentary satisfaction which
art affords to all our unfulfilled longings by its semblance
of reality. Strong desire always creates for itself an
imaginary gratification which easily leads the uncritical
mind to a belief in the power of will over the external
world. The whole of art-creation may thus be looked
upon as an embodiment of the greatest wishes of mankind,
which have sought the most convincing appearance
of their fulfilment in the form and shape of objective
works. What is in us a conscious and intentional self-deception,
may be in the unsophisticated man a real
illusion. The main psychological aspects of the activity
could not be changed by these different subjective attitudes
on the part of the producer. The essential point
is that in both cases the greatest possible resemblance to
the original would be sought for in order to increase in
the one case the magical efficacy of the work, in the
other the pleasure to be derived from the illusion. The
belief in a magical connection between similar things
would thus exercise an incalculable influence on the
growth of realism in art. But, unfortunately, this easy
explanation is not corroborated by an impartial examination
of the lower stages of art-development. The
statement of M. Guaita as to the volt, <i lang="fr">Plus la ressemblance
est complète plus le maléfice a chance de
réussir</i>,<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> does not appear to be borne out by the evidence.
The only instance we know of in which greater or less
resemblance to the model is thought of as bearing on
the magical efficacy of a painting is that of the East
Indian artists. We are told that it was in order to
evade the Mohammedan prohibition of painting that
they resorted to that style of treating nature, bordering
on caricature, which is so characteristic of, say, Javanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
art.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> Similarly it is by an appeal to their virtue of non-resemblance
that artists among the Laos defend their
pictures as being harmless and innocent.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> But such
references to barbaric or semi-barbaric art do not tell
us much about the conditions prevailing at the beginning
of art-development. The primitive man who avails himself
of dolls and drawings in order to bewitch is generally
quite indifferent to the life-like character of his magical
instruments. The typical volt gives only a crude outline
of the human body, and, which is most remarkable, it
does not display any likeness to the man who is to be
bewitched. As a rule the same vagueness can also be
noticed in the paintings and sculptures which serve the
aims of medical cure and religious cultus. With due
allowance for the deficient technical ability and the naïve
suggestibility of primitive man, it seems hard to believe
that illusion could have been either intended or effected
by the rude works of pictorial magic. Thus it becomes
doubtful whether the belief in the magical power of
painting and sculpture can have been based upon a confusion
between subjective and objective reality.</p>

<p>This doubt can only be increased when we see how
little confidence primitive men themselves put in the
mere likeness as such. When M. Rochas produced his
modern imitations of the volt, he was always anxious to
have his wax dolls sufficiently saturated by contact
with the person over whom they were intended to
give him power.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> And in this he closely followed the
methods of the native sorcerers, who generally tried to
increase the efficiency of their magical instruments by
attaching to them such objects as nail-cuttings, locks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
hair, or pieces of cloth belonging to the man to be
bewitched.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> In the making of idols we can often
observe the same principle. The statue itself is not
sacred by virtue of its form; it acquires divine power only
by being put in <i>material</i> connection with the deity. The
most obvious example is that of the West African
Negroes, who, when they wish to transplant the wood
deity from his original home to their towns and villages,
build up a wooden doll of branches taken from the tree
in which he lives.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> The god is certainly supposed to feel
a special temptation to take up his abode in the idol
made in his own likeness; but it is evident that the
material link established by the choice of the wood is
thought of as being of no less, perhaps even of greater,
importance than the resemblance. The same close and
inseparable combination of magic by connection and
magic by similarity meets us in the ancestor statues of
New Guinea, which contain the skull of the dead in
hollows inside their head.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> And although the procedure
is more indirect, the underlying thought is nevertheless
the same in the curious practices found, <i>e.g.</i>, on the
island of Nias. The spirit of the deceased is here conducted
to his statue by means of some small animal
which has been found in the neighbourhood of his grave.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
In none of these examples—which might be supple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>mented
by analogous instances from various tribes—do
we see any hint of that manner of regarding statues
and paintings which prevails among civilised men.
While with us the mental impression on the spectator
constitutes, so to speak, the object and the essential
purport of the work of art, the magicians and the
idolaters seem to look chiefly for material power and
influence in their simulacra.</p>

<p>The way in which pictorial art is used for curative
purposes affords us—if further proofs are wanted—a
still more telling example of the difference between the
magical and the aesthetic points of view. Nothing
could be more crude and primitive than the notions
held by the Navajo with regard to the salutary influences
of their famous sand-paintings. The cure is
effected, they believe, not by the patient’s looking at
the represented figures, but by his rolling himself on
them, or having the pigments of the mosaic applied to
the corresponding parts of his own body. The more of
the sacred sand he can thus attach to his body, the
more complete is his recovery.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Among other tribes
at the same stage of development as the Navajos the
prevailing views are almost equally materialistic.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> And
even among the barbaric and semi-civilised peoples,
although we do not meet with quite as gross superstitions,
the fundamental idea of pictorial magic appears
often to be the same. The power of a painting or a
sculpture is thought of as something which is quite
independent of its mental effects upon the spectator.
That interpretation of sympathetic magic, therefore,
which to us seemed most natural, cannot possibly be
applied to its lower forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>As the concepts by which primitive man justifies to
himself his beliefs and practices are naturally vague and
hazy, it may seem futile to attempt to reconstruct his
reasoning. Nothing final or definite can be asserted on
so obscure a topic. But we may legitimately discuss
the most consistent and most probable way in which to
account for the various forms of sympathetic magic.
And with regard to this question of probabilities we
may rely to some extent upon the illustrative and
suggestive analogies to primitive thought which can be
found in scientific philosophies. For it is evident that
a philosophical doctrine, if it fits in with the facts of
primitive superstition, may be explanatory of those
vague and latent notions which, without logical justification
or systematical arrangement, lie in the mind of
the magician and the idolater. Such a doctrine is presented
to us in the familiar emanation-theories, according
to which every image of a thing constitutes a
concrete part of that thing itself. According to the
clear and systematic statement of this doctrine given
by the old Epicurean philosophers, shadows, reflections
in a mirror, visions, and even mental representations
of distant objects, are all caused by thin membranes,
which continually detach themselves from the surface
of all bodies and move onward in all directions through
space.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> If there are such things as necessary misconceptions,
this is certainly one. Such general facts of
sensuous experience as reflection, shadow, and mirage
will naturally appear as the result of a purely material
decortication—as in a transfer picture.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> How near at
hand this theory may lie even to the modern mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
appears from the curious fact that such a man as Balzac
fell back upon it when attempting to explain the newly-invented
daguerreotype, that most marvellous of all
image-phenomena.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>To the primitive mind it is only natural to apply
this reasoning even to artificial images. Whether the
likeness of a thing is fashioned by nature in water or
air, or whether it be made by man, it is in both cases
thought of as depriving the thing itself of some part of
its substance. Such a notion, which cannot surprise us
when met with among the lower savages, seems to have
been at the bottom of even the Mohammedan prohibition
of the formative arts.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> It is evident that, wherever
images are explained in this crude manner, magic by
similarity in reality becomes merely a case of magic by
contiguity.</p>

<p>The materialistic thought which lies behind the
belief in a solidarity between similar things appears
nowhere so clearly as within the department of pictorial
magic. But we believe that its influence can also be
traced in all the other superstitions regarding sympathetic
causation. In spite of that feeling of superiority
so common in nations which have no leaning towards
formative arts, poetical and musical magic in its lower
forms is founded on quite as crude a conception as any
idolatry or pictorial sorcery. It would indeed be unnatural
if the theory of corporeal emanations had not
been applied to acoustic as well as to optical phenomena.
To the unscientific mind sounds and reverberations are
something quite synonymous with sights and reflections.
The sounds connected with the impression of a being,
thing, or phenomenon will therefore be conceived as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
being a part of the being, thing, or phenomenon itself.
To these easily-explained notions there are to be added
the peculiar superstitions entertained with regard to a
class of sounds which are only associated with things,
viz. their names. To the primitive man a name literally
constitutes a part of the object it denotes. The magician
may therefore get the mastery over the spirits he invokes
and the men he bewitches by merely mentioning
their names.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> In many cases a most potent spell consists
of unintelligible words, which to the conjurer himself
has no meaning at all. In other cases, although the
words really have a sense, we can easily observe that
they are not used for the purpose of creating an illusion
of reality. The typical incantation may indeed in a
manner be called descriptive. The singer is anxious
not to pass by any detail, the omitting of which may
be injurious to the potency of his magic. But the
result is only a sort of inventory, which seldom suggests
a full and vivid mental picture. Many of the Shaman
prayers and songs show us by their whole character that
in their case at least poetical illusion has had nothing
to do with the belief in the power of words over things.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>Thus, according to the magical-world view, a system
of material connections links together in close solidarity
things and their images, sounds, or names. But this
network of connections may even, we believe, extend
further, so as to bring into its chain of causation
qualities and actions, in short, abstract notions, which
cannot be considered as material objects possessing
material parts. Just as an image which presents the
figure and shape of a given thing is conceived as a part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
of that thing itself, so all things which have distinctive
qualities in common may be thought of as being parts
of a common whole. As a fantastic but still natural
product of the primitive mind, there may thus appear
the idea of an invisible connection, which binds together
all things similar and draws them to each other.
Vaguely and dimly even savages may have been able to
anticipate in some measure those imposing thoughts
which received an organised and consistent statement
in the doctrine of universal ideas. But to primitive
man these “ideas” must appear as concrete objects and
beings, exercising their influence on phenomena in a
quite material manner.</p>

<p>To those who are familiar with that peculiar combination
of spiritual conceptions of the world and
material conceptions of the spirit which makes up the
primitive cosmology, this explanation will not appear
far-fetched or strained. But it is to be admitted that
in many cases it may be difficult, or even impossible, to
lay one’s finger on the elements of magic by contiguity
which lie at the root of a given instance of imitative
witchcraft. No doubt the mental effects produced by
the imitation on its creator and spectators will in many
cases contribute to the belief in its power. In the more
artistic forms of poetic magic the suggestive power of
the words replaces the brute force of their sound. And
in dramatic magic an illusion, whether intended or unintended,
must necessarily affect the performers as well
as their audience. Therefore, however the psychological
basis of magic may be explained, it cannot be denied
that in some of its developments magic has become
closely connected with art. The self-deceit by which
we enjoy in art the confusion between real and unreal
is indeed, by its intentional character, distinct from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
illusion to which primitive man is led, more perhaps by
his deficient powers of observation than by any strength
of imaginative faculty. But still there exists a kinship,
and that belief in an overlapping of the tangible and
intangible life which is fostered by magic in the lower
art affords, as it were, a premonition of the effects produced
by imagination in the higher.</p>

<small>CONCLUSIONS</small></h2></div>


<p>There are several aspects of the history of art which
have had to be ignored in the preceding chapters. A
student of ethnology, for instance, will blame us because
in our hasty review of primitive art no mention has
been made of the important influence which political
institutions and religious systems have exercised on the
development of art. Nor can there be any question of
denying that these factors ought to be properly treated
of in every research which aims at a <i>descriptive</i> completeness.
From the historical point of view indeed
nothing could be more interesting than to pursue
throughout the general history of art that line of
investigation which Mr. Posnett has applied to the
study of literature. Not only in the lower stages of
culture, but also among civilised nations, one might
show how in all its forms and branches art has been
influenced for good and bad by the progress of
political development. Tribal drama, tribal sculpture,
and tribal poetry might thus be instructively contrasted
with the art of commonwealths and monarchic states.
Still wider results might be attained by tracing those
differences in types of art which arise from differences
in the religious systems. But such researches, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
important they might be, would not have much bearing
upon the subject of the present work. Notwithstanding
the differentiation of art-forms that has arisen from the
varying political and religious conditions, we do not
meet in these different forms with any principle of art
that has not been treated of already in the preceding
chapters. To explain, for instance, the art which serves
as a means of political propitiation, we need only refer
to our investigation of the æsthetic forms of sexual
selection. It is true that songs, dances, and pantomimes
will necessarily change in character when addressed to
a chief or king instead of to a woman. But the purpose—to
gain the favour of the spectator—is still the same in
both cases. And from this identity of purpose there
arises a general similarity between all manifestations
of propitiatory art, which, from our point of view, is
more important than the individual differences of these
manifestations. As in tribes where social conditions
have favoured the development of sexual selection
erotic art acquires the distinction of attractiveness and
sensuous beauty, so these qualities will also be prominent
in the songs and dances by which people endeavour to
conciliate the favour and benevolence of a mighty ruler.
And as on the lower stages of culture men attribute to
their gods their own likings and aversions, the same
qualities will naturally be found to characterise those
classes of art by which worshippers pay their homage
to a divine spectator. And, finally, as a conspicuous
outcome of the motive “to attract by pleasing” we
meet with a similar group of dances, songs, and pantomimes
addressed to the spirits of the deceased—those
spectators whose favour or disfavour is of paramount
importance to primitive man.</p>

<p>Side by side with this element of propitiation we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
find in the artistic manifestations connected with funeral
ceremonies examples of almost all those aspects of
art to which attention has been called in the preceding
chapters. The purpose of information is represented by
pictorial, poetic, or dramatic representations in which
the doings of the deceased are displayed before the
survivors.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> The dances and songs may in many cases
be reasonably explained as aiming at a stimulation of
the spirit, which certainly needs an increase of force in
order to surmount all the hardships and the weary
wanderings of its transitional life.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> In other cases funeral
art is evidently intended to produce upon invisible
enemies the same kind of terrifying effects which have
already been spoken of in connection with military
paintings and pantomimes.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> And, lastly, it is probably
in the endeavour to exert a sympathetic influence upon
the combats which the deceased must undergo before
he can attain his peace and rest that the survivors hold
magical sham-fights and tugs of war over his grave.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
Thus in this one branch of art we can see how each of
the sociological art-principles is of much wider applicability
than has been possible to trace within the limits
of this work. But, on the other hand, the crucial instance
of funeral art shows us how even in such artistic
manifestations as at the outset appear to be quite
irreducible we may by a closer investigation reveal the
influence of those general factors which have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
selected for treatment in the preceding chapters. And
therefore, without entering upon a detailed examination
of all the varying forms of art, we feel entitled to hold
that the utilitarian motives of information, propitiation,
stimulation, and magical efficiency afford a sufficiently
complete list—from a theoretical point of view—of the
most important non-æsthetic factors that have favoured
the development of art.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The attentive reader will probably have remarked
that those very aspects of art with which we have been
engaged in the latter part of this work broadly correspond
to some of the most important interpretations
of the art-impulse offered by æsthetic theories. To give
information—that is, to widen our knowledge of nature
and life; to propitiate—that is, to flatter our senses
by the display of beauty; to stimulate—that is, to
heighten our vital energy, and thus make life easier to
live and life’s work easier to perform; to work magic—that
is, to produce an illusion of reality capable of
leading to a confusion between the subjective and objective
world;—these are all purposes which have been
represented as essential to art. From our summary investigation
of primitive art it has, we hope, appeared
how fully we admit the close connection of these purposes
with the historical development of art. And it
might be shown, if our investigation were pursued into
the later stages of development, that art on its highest
plane still bears the same relation to concrete utilities
as it does on the lowest. Art never ceases to inform,
never ceases to please, never ceases to stimulate, never
loses something of a magical efficacy. But while
acknowledging the importance of all these purposes, we
have, on the other hand, to maintain the view which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
set out in the psychological chapters of the opening—that
it is only by assuming an independent art-impulse
that we can explain the essential character of art. To
make plain the distinction between these two points of
view it is advisable to summarise in brief the arguments
of either part of our investigation.</p>

<p>In the first chapters the writer attempted to show
that the art-impulse in its broadest sense must be taken
as an outcome of the natural tendency of every feeling-state
to manifest itself externally, the effect of such a
manifestation being to heighten the pleasure and to
relieve the pain. We found in this fact the primary
source of art as an individual impulse. But art is essentially
social; and this also we explained on psychological
grounds. The secondary effect of the exteriorisation of
a feeling-state is to awaken similar feelings in other
human beings who perceive the manifestation; and their
sympathetic feeling acts upon the author of the original
manifestation, heightening in him the feeling-state
which gave rise to it.</p>

<p>Now, all works of art have a common element notwithstanding
their diversity. They express, each in
their own medium, a mood or moods of the artist; they
arise, that is, out of the impulse to expression, which is
as primitive as feeling itself. Every man seeks automatically
to heighten his feelings of pleasure and to
relieve his feelings of pain. The artist is the man who
finds that he can gain such enhancement or relief, not
only by the direct action of giving expression to his
feeling, but also by arousing a kindred feeling in others.
Hence originates in him that desire to transmit his
moods to an external audience which must be regarded
as the simplest and most primordial inducement to
artistic production. And also as a further means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
realising the same purpose there arises the endeavour to
give the artistic product—that is to say, the externalised
expression of his mood—a form which may facilitate the
revival of the original state in an ever wider circle of
sympathisers. Thus from the reflex outlet for a strong
emotional pressure we are led to a deliberate creation,
in which the intellectual and volitional elements preponderate
increasingly over the automatic, emotional
impulse. But from this gain in consciousness there
does not result any change in the essential character
of the artistic activity. However great the difference
between the highest forms of art, such as, for instance,
a drama or a sculpture, and the primitive dance-pantomime,
the underlying impulse is still the same in both
cases. Perpetuation—that is, expression which is addressed
to a fictitious audience—can only be explained
by reference to the enhancing and relieving effects
which man has experienced as results of emotional
transmission. And all the intentional activities, the
artistic composition, the artistic technique, and so on, by
which perpetuation is secured can thus be regarded as
subservient to the emotionalistic purpose. Moreover,
these same activities, however unemotional they may
be in themselves, will enable the artist to extort an
increased emotional value from his “motives”; for instance,
the greater a man’s skill in suggesting the
peculiar thrill of colour, the greater will be his pleasure
in colour itself. Technical excellency, which to the
outsider is a cold and neutral thing, may thus to the
artist and to the intelligent critic be full of expressional
significance. From whichever point of view we may
look at art, we shall have to interpret its central and
essential characteristics in terms of feeling. In this
way we can account for it as a self-sufficing, or as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
have said, autotelic activity. And in this way only
can we explain the strength of that compelling force
which urges an artist to an exertion from which he
derives no external utility.</p>

<p>But it cannot be contended that primitive human
nature furnishes not only the impulse to expression but
also the medium. The artist in man had the feeling;
he had to discover a way to exteriorise it. Nearest
perhaps to primitive art lie the immediate manifestations
by regulated gesture and regulated sounds of the voice,
which are also in their highest development the most
potent means for transmitting an emotion. Yet the
different utilities of life offered also other means—as it
were, words of a language—in which the feeling could
express itself and transmit itself from mind to mind.
The man who used drawing as a means of communicating
thoughts could express in a drawing the terror which
a beast inspired or the delight he had derived from
watching its movements. And just as the purpose of
imparting information—whether by word or image—afforded
a natural medium through which the art-impulse
could work to its own ends, so also the purpose
of propitiation afforded in dance or decoration something
which might be diverted from its original object
and be used with the single intention of expressing, for
instance, the dancer’s mood. Similarly each of the other
purposes that have been discussed or alluded to
afforded, as it were, a concrete material for art—a shape
in which the primitive impulse to gesture could embody
and develop itself. And beyond the fact that art has
been obliged to avail itself of media which have originally
been called into existence by utilitarian, non-æsthetic
needs, there lies another fact. To these
external “origins” we can also trace some of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
important qualities which we appreciate in a work of
art. In this way it is open to us to explain how
several of the virtues of art, as we know it, may be
derived from the primitive needs which it subserved;
how, for instance, the lucidity of art may find its explanation
in art’s use for conveying information; how
the sensuous and attractive qualities of all art may be
traced to the need for propitiating favour; how the
power that resides in art to brace and stimulate the
mind may be transmitted from the days when the artist
was appointed to nerve his fellows for work or war.
And, lastly, it might be argued that a most characteristic
quality of art, the imagination, which is in a sense faith
in the reality of the unreal (whether native to the
human mind or not), may have been immensely
heightened by the use of art for purposes of magic,
which fuses the visible and the invisible.</p>

<p>There is thus suggested a further point. We were
able to derive those qualities of artistic composition, which
in all æsthetic systems have been insisted on as the most
primordial, from the distinctive qualities of the self-sufficing
art-impulse, by showing how the unity, the
concentration, and the subordination of parts to a whole
correspond to the unity of a feeling-state which it is the
object of the art-impulse to convey and to perpetuate in
its entirety. On the other hand, we are forced to
acknowledge that by the side of these primordial
qualities there exist certain secondary qualities which
have been of great importance in facilitating and securing
the transmission and perpetuation of the original feeling-state;
and we have shown how these qualities arise out
of the vassalage by which art in its historical development
has been bound to the necessities and utilities of
practical life. For those who crave a theoretical basis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
for the estimation of art there is offered a field of
research in the comparison and relative valuation of
these two orders of qualities. By studying the alternate
influences which the primary and the derived factors
have exercised on the character of works of art, it may
even be possible to lay down a kind of scale by which
to rank general qualities as well as individual manifestations.
But all this train of thought, though cognate to
our inquiry, is not a part of it. This book has aimed
simply to give an answer to the question, How did art
originate? To those minds which see no value in an
æsthetic inquiry that neither purposes to offer guidance
for the artist in producing works of art, nor for the
student in appreciating them, the whole discussion may
probably appear futile. The author on his part has
thought that such investigation into an important and
typical human energy must be of interest at least, if not
of value. But upon the practical question it is his
personal opinion that the loss would be greater than the
gain if theories and judgments based upon philosophical
considerations were allowed to influence either the
production or the enjoyment of art.</p>

differently explained by Catlin, the Sioux bear dance (<i>l.c.</i> i. p. 245)
is no doubt as magical in its intention as the buffalo dance. The same interpretation
holds good also, we believe, with regard to the gorilla dance of the
Negroes (Reade, <i>Savage Africa</i>, pp. 195, 196) and the hunting pantomimics of the

“expression” may change the tone of an emotion. Cf. especially p. 519 about

brought together by Mr. William Archer in his <i>Masks or Faces</i>, do not give us
much reliable information as to the part which the “expressional movements”
play in a deliberate stirring up of an emotion. Even if we were to accept all the
testimonies of actors and actresses as a testable evidence, we could scarcely decide
whether the emotional state of an actor who plays his part in perfect sincerity
is chiefly a result of his losing himself in the fictitious situation, or whether this
state follows as a retroaction exercised by the artificial performance of weeping,
laughing, sobbing, etc. Cf. Archer, <i>Masks or Faces</i>, pp. 133-136. Some interesting
remarks on this point can also be found in Dugald Stewart’s <i>Elements
of the Philosophy of the Human Mind</i>, iii. pp. 168, 185.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_94" href="#FNanchor_94" class="label">[94]</a> It cannot be denied, however, that in many cases the self-wounding is
executed as a traditional, superstitious, or sacrificial rite. The Maori funeral
ceremonies, in which the apparently impulsive and exalted cutting is “done
with considerable method and regularity, so as to make the scars ornamental
rather than otherwise,” can thus scarcely be adduced as a genuine instance of
emotional expression. Cf. Robley, <i>Moko</i>, p. 46. Still less are we entitled to
speak in this connection of those Polynesian funeral ceremonies in which the
survivors lacerate themselves and allow the blood to drop on the face of the
corpse or under its bier. Cf. the instances of such superstitious self-woundings
collected in Hartland, <i>The Legend of Perseus</i>, ii. pp. 241, 321-325.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_95" href="#FNanchor_95" class="label">[95]</a> On woundings in medical cures, cf. esp. Bartels, <i>Medicin der Naturvölker</i>,
pp. 267-271; Curr, <i>The Australian Race</i>, ii. pp. 69, 70 (The Dieyerie Tribe,
by Gason); Ling Roth, <i>Tasmania</i>, pp. 75, 76; Man, <i>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</i> xii.
p. 85 (Andamanese); Mouat, <i>Andaman Islands</i>, p. 307; Bourke, <i>Rep. Bur. Ethn.</i>,
1887-88, p. 471 (Medicine-men of the Apache. Scarification resorted to in
order to relieve exhaustion); Keating, <i>Narrative of an Expedition</i>, i. p. 226,
quotes the interesting conceptions entertained by the Sauks and Foxes as to
the result of lacerations. The wounds are inflicted at funerals, “not for the
purpose of mortification, or to create a pain, which shall, by dividing their
attention, efface the recollection of their loss, but entirely from a belief that their
grief is internal, and that the only way of dispelling it is to give it a vent
through which to escape.” There seems to be no doubt that similar notions
have led to the curing of bodily pain by bleeding.</p>

<p>As to laceration as a means of overcoming humiliation see Curr, <i>l.c.</i> ii. p. 70
(Dieyerie). Even joy, when abnormally strong, seems often to express itself in
this way. Ellis, <i>Pol. Res.</i> i. p. 410 (Tahiti); Pritchard, <i>Pol. Rem.</i> p. 138
(Samoa); Péron, <i>Voyage</i>, i. p. 227 (Tasmanians, who scratch themselves in the
face and tear the hair in their enthusiasm, when hearing the Marseillaise performed);
Bernier, <i>L’art du comédien</i>, p. 310.</p>

<p>As connected with the emotion of joy we may also explain the occurrences
of self-woundings at meetings between friends. Cf. esp. Lumholtz, <i>Among
Cannibals</i>, pp. 224, 225. It is not to be overlooked that in many tribes friends
express their delight at meetings by a ceremonial weeping and wailing. Cf.
Man, <i>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</i> xii. p. 147; Day, <i>Proc. As. Soc. Bengal</i>, 1870, p. 157,
both on the Andamanese; Batchelor, <i>The Ainu</i>, p. 105; Taylor, <i>Te Ika A Maui</i>,
p. 103; Angas, <i>Savage Life</i>, ii. pp. 32, 73, 109, all on New Zealand; Freycinet,
<i>Voyage</i>, ii. p. 589 (The Sandwich Islands); Lander, <i>Journal</i>, i. pp. 148, 149
(Yoruba Country); and the instances quoted in Spencer, <i>Principles of Sociology</i>,
ii. pp. 20, 70, 71. As this apparently paradoxical expression can be explained in
many cases as a conventional ceremony, which is not accompanied by any
genuine feeling, so the self-wounding may often be a purely ritual observance.
But although some of the above adduced instances can thus be considered as
spurious, we nevertheless feel right in assuming that an impulsive creation of
pain is generally to be derived from the psychical conditions accompanying
high-strung emotion. This is also the conclusion at which Mr. Brinton and Mr.
Andrew Lang have arrived. Cf. Brinton, <i>Religion of Primitive Peoples</i>, p. 213;
Lang, <i>The Making of Religion</i>, p. 310.</p>

p. 368. It is scarcely necessary to point out to how great an extent the
emotional conveyance by means of dramatic action must have been strengthened
by the chorus, which, by its laughter or wailing, affords a kind of model expression
to the spectator. Possibly, indeed, the Greek chorus developed from a
ceremonial in which chorus and audience were not distinct but identical—a ritual
of wailings or rejoicings provoked by the recital of a traditional story. This
view, curiously in advance of his times, is suggested by Brown, an eighteenth
century philosopher (<i>History of the Rise of Poetry</i>, pp. 126-128): “How came
it to pass that in the more barbarous periods the number [of the chorus] should
be so much greater? Manifestly because that rude age bordered on the savage
times, when the <i>whole audience</i> had <i>sympathised</i> with the <i>narrative actor</i>, and
became as one general choir.”</p>

with regard to the theory of gesture-language as an intermediate stage of evolution,
speaks of gesture-language as made up by delineations and indications
(<i>Early Hist. of Mankind</i>, pp. 15, 16). In a theoretical discussion it is evidently
necessary to maintain a strict distinction between these different kinds of
pantomimic thought-conveyance, which are no doubt accompanied by different

who cannot make themselves understood by each other without the help of
gestures. Dr. Tylor’s criticism of Captain Burton’s statement that the Aropahos
“can hardly converse with one another in the dark” has been amply confirmed
by the subsequent researches of Mallery. Cf. <i>Rep. Bur. Ethn.</i> i. pp. 314, 315.
Naturally, therefore, one feels inclined to adopt a sceptical attitude with regard
to Miss Kingsley’s assertion that the language of the Bubis “depends so much
on gesture that they cannot talk in it to each other in the dark” (<i>Travels in
West Africa</i>, p. 439). Cf., however, with regard to the element of gesture in
West African languages, Kingsley, <i>West African Studies</i>, p. 237.</p>

contradictory. Mr. Curr (<i>The Australian Race</i>, i. p. 93) says that “some tribes
express a few things by signs made with their hands; but, on the whole, the
Australian is very little given to gesticulation.” This statement, however, has
been expressly encountered by Mr. Stirling, who describes a very extensive
system of signs. <i>Rep. Horn Exped.</i> iv. Anthropology, pp. 111-125. Cf. also

reason to fear the influence of malignant spirits. For instances of such funeral
ceremonies see Laing, <i>Travels</i>, p. 368 (Soolimas); Metz, <i>Neilgherry Hills</i>, pp.

Islands; Samoa: tattooings as connected with distinctions of rank). These
facts are, as Schmeltz remarks, in direct opposition to the statements of Finsch
in <i>Verhandlungen d. Berlin Anthropol. Gesellschaft</i>, 1879, p. 414.—Lütke does not
himself think that the richness of tattoo patterns on the Caroline Islands stands
in any relation to the rank of the tattooed individual; but he admits that some
members of his expedition had got such an impression, <i>Voyage</i>, i. pp. 359, 360.
The belief of the Fijians, to which so curious an analogy has been found among
the Eskimos (Lubbock, <i>Prehist. Times</i>, p. 565; Hall, <i>Arctic Researches</i>, p. 570),
that only tattooed people are entitled to happiness after death may perhaps be
connected with notions of an Elysium reserved for individuals of a certain rank.
Cf. also <i>Ymer</i>, iv. p. 317, on the views of the Pelew islanders as to nose ornaments
as a condition for entering the realm of spirits, and Finsch, <i>Ethnol. Erfahrungen</i>,
p. 316, quoting, with reservation, Kirby on a Gilbert’s Island paradise, open only

<p><a id="Footnote_342" href="#FNanchor_342" class="label">[342]</a> With regard to marks of tribal distinction compare the facts collected by
Spencer, <i>Principles of Sociology</i>, ii. pp. 72-75; Frazer, <i>Totemism</i>, pp. 26-30.
Even those who do not believe in Mr. Frazer’s assertion that the paintings,
coiffures, tattooings, etc., aim at an imitation of the totem animal, will be compelled
to admit that they often serve as means of distinguishing members of the
same totem group. Buckland, <i>Anthropological Studies</i>, pp. 224, 225, 231 (On
tattooing); Starcke, <i>The Primitive Family</i>, pp. 42, 62; Wuttke, <i>Geschichte der
Schrift</i>, i. pp. 80 <i>sq.</i></p>

<p>Further instances, unmentioned by these authors, are to be found in Godden,

In his account of the Niger tribes M. Binger has succeeded in minutely classifying
the tattoo patterns according to tribes and families (Binger, <i>Du Niger</i>, etc.,
ii. pp. 408-411). It is evidently impossible to decide to how great a degree the
uniformity in the decorative systems of the several tribes has its origin in an
intentional endeavour to develop a distinct tribal appearance. It may in many
cases be merely a result of limited powers of invention.</p>

<p>As to the scarification of the Australian natives the evidence seems to be
contradictory. If we are to believe Mr. Taplin’s informer, incisions on the
body would have been used by the Noocoonas in order to distinguish tribes
“before whites came” (Taplin, <i>Folklore of S. Australia</i>, p. 65). These assertions
have, however, been called in question by the informers of Curr (<i>Australian
Race</i>, ii. pp. 468, 475), by Spencer and Gillen (<i>Native Tribes</i>, pp. 42-44), and by
Stirling (<i>Rep. Horn Exp. IV. Anthropology</i>, p. 24); cf. also Roth, <i>N. W. C.

men who expect to become fathers. We cannot here dwell on the interesting
theories, according to which totemistic doctrines and regulations ought to be
interpreted as based upon the conception of a quite material substratum, connecting
for eternity with each other all individuals and generations of the same
family. However fantastic they may have appeared, the probability of these
views has undeniably been increased by the publication of those hitherto unknown
details of Australian ceremonialism that have been brought to light by
Messrs. Spencer and Gillen. But in questions like these it seems almost impossible
to discriminate between symbolical ideas and actions on the one hand,
and magical practices based on a real belief on the other.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
